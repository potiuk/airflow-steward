# Individual use — Magpie on any repo, without adopting it

> [!IMPORTANT]

## Overview

This is one of the two ways to use Magpie, and it asks nothing of anybody
else. You install the plugins you want and run them against whatever repo you
are working in — one that has [adopted Magpie](team-adoption.md), one that has
not, one whose maintainers have never heard of it, one where you are the only
person on the team who uses it. Nothing is committed, no shared settings file
changes, and no teammate has to do anything.

It is not a lesser path or a waiting room for adoption. Most people who use
Magpie use it exactly like this, indefinitely.

Two situations it covers, which used to be documented separately because they
looked different and are not:

- **The repo has not adopted Magpie.** You want to help with a fix, triage an
  issue, or run a security audit without waiting for the project to decide
  anything.
- **Your teammates have not adopted it.** You work on a shared repo and want
  Magpie for yourself, without asking anyone to change how they work.

A **marketplace plugin install already covers this**: Claude Code keeps
plugin state in one user-scope store (`~/.claude/plugins/`), so a plugin you
install once is available in every repo you open next, adopted or not —
nothing project-specific is required. See
[Step 1](#step-1--marketplace-install-recommended-covers-every-repo) below.
The rest of this recipe is the **`.apache-magpie-local/`** personal override
directory (added in the framework's override surface; see
[`agentic-overrides.md`](agentic-overrides.md)): a gitignored directory that
lives in the target repo and provides your personal config layer. Because it
is gitignored (and contains no binaries), adding it to a repo you do not own
is safe and non-intrusive.

The recipe has four steps:

1. **Marketplace install** (recommended) — install the plugins you want once;
   they are then available in every repo, adopted or not. A pinned-snapshot
   whole-user install is the fallback, for when a marketplace is not
   reachable.
2. **Add one `.gitignore` line** — keep your personal config untracked.
3. **Create `.apache-magpie-local/`** — optionally add your overrides.
4. **Run skills** — invoke them as if the project were adopted.

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** installed and working (see
  [`docs/prerequisites.md`](../prerequisites.md)).
- **Secure agent setup** installed — run
  [`/magpie-setup-isolated-setup-install`](../../skills/setup-isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md)
  with **whole-user (global) scope** once. This sets up the sandbox
  allowlist for every repo on your host, not just adopted ones.  If you
  have already done this for another Magpie-adopted project on this machine,
  skip this sub-step — whole-user scope covers the target repo automatically.

## Step 1 — Marketplace install (recommended): covers every repo

Add the marketplace and install the plugins you want, exactly as in the
[quick start](../quick-start.md):

```text
/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie
/plugin install magpie-setup@apache-magpie
/plugin install magpie-pr-management@apache-magpie
```

That's it — nothing else in this step. Claude Code's plugin state lives in
one user-scope store (`~/.claude/plugins/`), so the skills are now available
in every repo you open on this machine, Project X included, whether or not
Project X has adopted Magpie. Skip to
[Step 2](#step-2--in-the-target-repo-add-one-gitignore-line).

### Fallback — pinned-snapshot whole-user install

Use this instead of Step 1 only when a marketplace is not reachable (no
plugin mechanism for your agent, or the project wants the signed ASF source
release rather than a git clone).

In a normal project adoption, Magpie's skills are installed as gitignored
symlinks under `.agents/skills/` (canonical) and `.claude/skills/` (Claude
Code relay). Those symlinks exist only in the adopted repo and its
worktrees.

For a non-adopted repo you need the skills at **user scope** so Claude
Code can find them regardless of what directory you are in.

### Clone the framework to a stable personal location

Pick a directory that will not move — you are about to create symlinks
that point into it. A common convention:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 --branch main \
    https://github.com/apache/magpie.git \
    ~/dev/magpie
```

You can use any local path. The depth `--depth=1` keeps the clone small;
re-clone (or `git pull`) to refresh later.

### Symlink framework skills to your user-scope skills directory

Claude Code reads skills from `~/.claude/skills/` (user scope) in every
session, regardless of the project directory. Link all framework skills
there:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills

for skill_dir in ~/dev/magpie/skills/*/; do
    skill_name=$(basename "$skill_dir")
    target=~/.claude/skills/magpie-${skill_name}
    # Overwrite stale link on re-run; skip if the name somehow collides
    ln -snf "$skill_dir" "$target"
done
```

Verify the links are in place:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/ | grep ^magpie-
```

You should see entries like `magpie-pr-management-triage`,
`magpie-issue-triage`, `magpie-security-issue-import`, etc. — one per
framework skill.

> **Why not `~/.agents/skills/`?** Claude Code's native user-scope path is
> `~/.claude/skills/`. Other agents (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, …) use
> `~/.agents/skills/`. Add a parallel `~/.agents/skills/` loop if you want
> the skills available user-scope in those agents too; the framework's
> per-project canonical dir is `.agents/skills/`, but the user-scope
> equivalent is left to each user's dotfile setup.

### Keeping user-scope skills current

When the framework publishes updates, pull and refresh the links:

```bash
cd ~/dev/magpie && git pull
# Re-run the symlink loop (idempotent; ln -snf updates stale targets):
for skill_dir in ~/dev/magpie/skills/*/; do
    skill_name=$(basename "$skill_dir")
    ln -snf "$skill_dir" ~/.claude/skills/magpie-${skill_name}
done
```

The symlinks resolve through to the updated source files automatically —
you only need to re-run the loop when new skills are added to the
framework (so new `magpie-*` names appear) or when old ones are removed
(so stale links are pruned).

## Step 2 — In the target repo: add one `.gitignore` line

In the target (unadopted) repo, tell git not to track your personal
config:

```bash
echo '/.apache-magpie-local/' >> .gitignore
```

This is the **only change to committed files** that this recipe requires.
You can omit it if you plan to add `.apache-magpie-local/` to your global
gitignore instead (`~/.gitignore_global` or equivalent); either approach
keeps the directory untracked.

If you do not want to touch the repo's `.gitignore` at all, add the entry
to your global gitignore:

```bash
git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore_global
echo '/.apache-magpie-local/' >> ~/.gitignore_global
```

## Step 3 — Create your personal config directory

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/target-repo/.apache-magpie-local
```

The directory may be empty. Magpie skills check for
`.apache-magpie-local/<skill-name>.md` before applying framework defaults
— if the file is absent, defaults apply without error.

### Optional — add skill overrides

If you need a Project-X-specific behaviour adjustment, write it as
agent-readable Markdown in a file named after the skill:

```bash
cat > /path/to/target-repo/.apache-magpie-local/pr-management-triage.md <<'EOF'
### Override 1 — Require two approvals for merge

This project requires two approving reviews before a PR is
merged (team policy, not enforced by GitHub branch protection
yet). Treat a PR as mergeable only when it has ≥ 2 approvals.
EOF
```

Overrides follow the same **additive-only** contract as committed
overrides: they may add project-specific context, adjust defaults, or
enable an extra capability (e.g. a release-manager enabling an extra MCP)
— they may **not** weaken the safety, confidentiality, or privacy baseline
the framework always applies.

See [`agentic-overrides.md`](agentic-overrides.md) for the full override
contract and example shapes (skip a step, replace a step, add a step,
pre-empt a decision-table row).

## Step 4 — Run skills against the target repo

Open the target repo's directory in Claude Code and invoke any installed
skill. **On the marketplace install** (Step 1), use `/<plugin>:<alias>`:

```text
/magpie-pr-management:triage
/magpie-issue:triage
/magpie-security:issue-import
/magpie-release-management:audit-report
```

**On the pinned-snapshot fallback**, use the single-token `magpie-` name
instead:

```text
/magpie-pr-management-triage
/magpie-issue-triage
/magpie-security-issue-import
/magpie-release-audit-report
```

Either way, the skills are at user scope, so Claude Code finds them
regardless of what project you are in. The skill reads
`.apache-magpie-local/<skill-name>.md` (if present) before applying
framework defaults, so your personal overrides are honoured without any
project-wide config.

You will see the skill's **override disclosure** at the top: it names the
file it read and lists the override headlines, so you know exactly what
personal adjustments are active before the skill does anything.

## What your teammates see (nothing)

From a teammate's perspective:

- The `.gitignore` change (if you commit it) adds one line. They can ignore it.
- The `.apache-magpie-local/` directory is gitignored and never shows up in
  `git status` or in a PR for them.
- No shared settings file changes. No committed skill symlinks. No
  `.apache-magpie.lock`.
- Their own sessions are unaffected — anything user-scope lives in your home
  directory, not theirs.

## Skills that assume everyone has Magpie

Most skills act only on behalf of the person invoking them and need nothing
from your teammates. A few coordinate across contributors — assigning reviewers
from a configured roster, sending onboarding mail, checking reviewer load — and
those degrade gracefully when run this way: they work from the data available
to you, and cannot read teammate configuration they cannot reach.

If a skill instead fails outright with something like "no `<project-config>/`
found", it is trying to read a committed project config that this repo does not
have. Either add a minimal `project.md` to your `.apache-magpie-local/` to
satisfy the lookup, or
[report it](../../skills/report-framework-issue/SKILL.md) so the skill is fixed
to degrade gracefully instead.

Skills that write to shared project state — labels, PR assignments, roster
files — are the ones that benefit most from the project having
[adopted Magpie](team-adoption.md), because then the team has agreed on what
the agent may touch.

## What works vs what doesn't

| Works | Does not work |
|---|---|
| All workflow skills — `security-*`, `pr-management-*`, `issue-*`, `release-*`, `mentoring-*`, `pairing-*`, `repo-health-*` | `/magpie-setup install` / `verify` / `upgrade` — these manage the committed lock and snapshot, which do not exist here |
| Personal overrides via `.apache-magpie-local/` | Shared overrides (`.apache-magpie-overrides/`) — the committed override directory requires the project to have adopted |
| `setup-isolated-setup-install` / `-verify` / `-doctor` (the secure-setup skills are user-scope artefacts, not per-project) | Drift detection (the skill checks for `.apache-magpie.lock`; finding none, it proceeds without it rather than erroring) |
| The full safety, confidentiality, and privacy baseline (always applied regardless of adoption state) | — |

If a skill raises an unexpected "adoption required" message on a step that
ought to work without adoption, that is a gap — file it on the framework
issue tracker so the step can be made adoption-optional.

## If the project later adopts Magpie

Nothing you did here is undone by that, and you do not have to switch paths.

[Adoption](team-adoption.md) commits a recommendation: a default set of
families that a contributor gets on clone, plus the repo's shared overrides. If
you already have those families installed, nothing changes for you. If you do
not, you can take the defaults or keep your own selection — the committed set
is a floor, not an allowlist.

Your `.apache-magpie-local/` keeps working either way. It sits at the top of
the override lookup chain (`.apache-magpie-local/` → `.apache-magpie-overrides/`
→ framework default), so your personal overrides still win. Once the project
has adopted, anything in there that everyone would want is worth moving into
the committed `.apache-magpie-overrides/` — and anything genuinely personal
should stay where it is.

If the project also takes the [pinned snapshot install](install-recipes.md) —
a separate decision from adopting — its project-scope skills will shadow any
user-scope symlinks you set up under the fallback path in Step 1.
