# Setup skill family

> **Scope.** Works on any project, ASF or not — no
> Apache-Software-Foundation-specific assumptions baked in.

> **Two ways to install, and they are complementary.** A **marketplace
> install** puts the skills straight into your agent, per machine, with
> nothing in the repo — the recommended path, see
> [the **Apache Magpie Marketplace**](marketplace.md). The **pinned snapshot install**,
> `/magpie-setup install`, sets up the gitignored snapshot, the skill
> symlinks, and the overrides scaffold in the repo so every contributor and CI
> job runs one committed version; reach for it when your agent has no
> marketplace, when you need the signed ASF source release, or when the
> project wants that pin. (`adopt` remains an accepted alias of `install`;
> `uninstall` / `unadopt` reverse it.)

The **setup** skill family is the prerequisite for running any
framework skill. It walks a new adopter (or a fresh dev machine on
an existing adopter) through the secure-agent install — pinned
system tools, the project-scope `.claude/settings.json` sandbox
block, the `claude-iso` clean-env wrapper, the user-scope hooks —
and through the ongoing housekeeping (verify install drift, pull
framework updates, sync shared user-scope config across machines).

Why a dedicated install skill family? The framework's other skills
run against pre-disclosure CVE content, private mailing lists, and
in-flight tracker discussions. Without the layered defence the
setup skills install (sandbox + permission rules + clean-env
wrapper), a misconfigured agent can leak credentials or
pre-disclosure content into the model provider's training data or
into a public PR. The setup family is what makes the rest of the
framework safe to use.

## Install & first runs

Install just this family — one plugin, 9 skills. Sandbox, clean environment, and the framework's own install/upgrade.

```text
/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie
/plugin install magpie-setup@apache-magpie
```

New to Magpie? The [quick start](../quick-start.md) walks the whole path in
one place — install, the first `/magpie-setup` run, and a recording of it
happening — plus the other agents and the secure-isolation setup to run next.

### The first run

This family is what the other nine defer to. `/magpie-setup` works out how
Magpie should be wired into the checkout in front of it, prints the plan, and
waits — the same run the quick start opens with:

![A `/magpie-setup` run in Claude Code: the marketplace install, then the skill detecting the checkout, printing the method and plan it intends to carry out, and waiting for approval before writing anything](../../assets/quickstart/magpie-setup.svg)

Nothing is written before you approve it.

### Try these first

*Illustrative shapes, not real transcripts — your output will differ. Nothing
below sends, merges, or posts anything without you confirming it.*

**Put the agent in its sandbox.**

```text
> /magpie-setup:isolated-setup-install

Proposed changes (nothing applied yet):
  1. .claude/settings.json   sandbox.enabled: true, 14 deny rules
  2. ~/.claude/scripts/      3 hooks + status line
  3. ~/.zshrc                source agent-iso.sh
Apply 1-3? [y/N]
```

**Check it landed.**

```text
> /magpie-setup:isolated-setup-verify

  OK   sandbox.enabled           true
  OK   permissions.deny          14 rules
  WARN pinned tools              bubblewrap 0.11.1 (want 0.11.2)
  OK   status line               wired
```

**See what is wired up.**

```text
> /magpie-setup:status

  install method   marketplace (magpie-setup, magpie-pr-management)
  agent targets    .agents/skills, .claude/skills
  drift            none
```

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`setup-isolated-setup-install`](../../skills/setup-isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md) | First-time install of the secure agent setup. |
| [`setup-isolated-setup-verify`](../../skills/setup-isolated-setup-verify/SKILL.md) | Verify the secure setup landed correctly (static checks on settings.json, hooks, pinned versions). |
| [`setup-isolated-setup-doctor`](../../skills/setup-isolated-setup-doctor/SKILL.md) | Diagnose in-session sandbox friction (SSH agent, port bind, docker/podman socket) and map each fail to a catalog entry. |
| [`setup-isolated-setup-update`](../../skills/setup-isolated-setup-update/SKILL.md) | Surface drift between the installed setup and the framework's latest. |
| [`setup`](../../skills/setup/SKILL.md) | Adopt and maintain the framework in a project repo through installation, verification, updates, overrides, and unadoption. |
| [`setup upgrade`](../../skills/setup/upgrade.md) | Pull the framework checkout to latest `origin/main`. |
| [`setup verify`](../../skills/setup/verify.md) | Verify the framework is integrated correctly into an adopter tracker. |
| [`setup-status`](../../skills/setup-status/SKILL.md) | Render a Markdown adoption dashboard (install pin, drift, wired agent targets, installed skill families, symlink health) and adjust the wiring in place. |
| [`setup-shared-config-sync`](../../skills/setup-shared-config-sync/SKILL.md) | Commit + push the user's shared Claude config to its sync repo. |
| [`setup-override-upstream`](../../skills/setup-override-upstream/SKILL.md) | Promote a local `.apache-magpie-overrides/<skill>.md` file into a PR against `apache/magpie`; prompts to remove the override once merged and upgraded. |
| [`setup-upstream-fix`](../../skills/setup-upstream-fix/SKILL.md) | Turn a framework bug or quirk hit mid-session into a fix PR against `apache/magpie`, after checking for an existing issue or PR that already covers it. |

## Deep documentation

- [**The Apache Magpie Marketplace**](marketplace.md) — the one marketplace
  the project publishes, and the recommended way to install. Every agent that
  can add it, per-family vs all-in-one plugins, pinning, updates, and
  verification status.
- [**`secure-agent-setup.md`**](secure-agent-setup.md) — full
  install walkthrough. The authoritative reference the
  `setup-isolated-setup-install` skill steps through.
- [**`secure-agent-internals.md`**](secure-agent-internals.md) —
  how the layered defence works (sandbox + permission rules +
  clean-env wrapper) and why each layer exists.
- [**`install-recipes.md`**](install-recipes.md) — copy-pasteable
  shell recipes (svn-zip / git-tag / git-branch) for bootstrapping
  `setup` into a new adopter repo.
- [**`uninstall.md`**](uninstall.md) — counterpart to `install-recipes.md`:
  remove the framework artefacts the install flow installed. One
  path, full plan surfaced before any write.
- [**`sandbox-troubleshooting.md`**](sandbox-troubleshooting.md) —
  catalog of known sandbox-shaped failure modes (SSH agent /
  Yubikey unreachable, test port-bind blocked, docker/podman
  socket denied) with symptom → root cause → settings.json fix
  for each. The page to grep when a normal-looking operation
  fails in the sandbox in an unexpected way.
- [**Team adoption**](team-adoption.md) — what a repo commits so every
  contributor arrives with a recommended set: the default plugin set, the
  shared overrides, and keeping both current. The maintainer half of the pair.
- [**Individual use**](individual-use.md) — using Magpie on any repo, adopted
  or not, with nothing committed and nothing asked of teammates. The other
  half.
- [**`per-role-mcp-access.md`**](per-role-mcp-access.md) — how to
  enable an MCP server for yourself only (e.g. a release manager
  enabling a Policy MCP, a security triage member enabling a
  private CVE database) without touching shared project config:
  register the server in user-scope Claude settings, then write a
  personal `.apache-magpie-local/<skill>.md` override.

## Typical lifecycle

```text
new dev machine
  ↓ setup-isolated-setup-install
isolated setup installed
  ↓ setup-isolated-setup-verify (any time, especially after Claude Code upgrade)
verified
  ↓ setup-isolated-setup-update (monthly / after Claude Code upgrade)
drift surfaced
  ↓ setup-upgrade (when framework releases something new)
framework checkout up to date
```

`setup-shared-config-sync` is orthogonal — it commits the user's
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and other shared config to a private sync
repo so a fresh dev machine can pick it up (run after editing any
file under `~/.claude-config/`).
