# Board resolution — Establish the Apache Magpie Project (draft)

> **Status:** *Draft.* Working text for the forthcoming ASF Board resolution
> establishing Apache Magpie as a Top-Level Project. The companion supporting
> document is [`MISSION.md`](../MISSION.md), which the Board is expected to
> read alongside the resolution.
>
> The resolution itself is short and procedural by ASF convention; rationale,
> roster lineage, scope justification, and the donated-code story live in
> `MISSION.md` rather than in the resolution body. The format below follows
> the standard ASF Board-resolution shape for a fresh-PMC establishment.

## Resolution text

> WHEREAS, the Board of Directors deems it to be in the best interests of the
> Foundation and consistent with the Foundation's purpose to establish a Project
> Management Committee charged with the creation and maintenance of open-source
> software, for distribution at no charge to the public, related to creation and
> maintenance of software related to agent-assisted repository maintainership
> and development, including issue and pull- request triage, contributor
> mentoring, agent-drafted remediation, developer-side development-cycle skills,
> and narrowly-scoped fix-and- merge automation.
>
> NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a Project Management Committee (PMC), to
> be known as the "Apache Magpie Project", be and hereby is established pursuant
> to Bylaws of the Foundation; and be it further
>
> RESOLVED, that the Apache Magpie be and hereby is responsible for the creation
> and maintenance of software related to creation and maintenance of software
> related to agent-assisted repository maintainership and development, including
> issue and pull- request triage, contributor mentoring, agent-drafted
> remediation, developer-side development-cycle skills, and narrowly-scoped
> fix-and- merge automation; and be it further
>
> RESOLVED, that the office of "Vice President, Apache Magpie" be and hereby is
> created, the person holding such office to serve at the direction of the Board
> of Directors as the chair of the Apache Magpie Project, and to have primary
> responsibility for management of the projects within the scope of
> responsibility of the Apache Magpie Project; and be it further
>

## Notes for the chair / proposer

These items are deliberately **not** in the resolution text — the resolution
stays short by ASF convention. They are kept here so the proposer remembers
to land them in the right place at the right time:

- **Donated code lineage** — the project is greenfield in terms of PMC, but
  inherits substantial project-agnostic code from existing ASF projects
  (Apache Airflow, where the framework was first developed and proven;
  Apache Groovy; and other ASF projects whose maintainers have been early
  adopters). All transferred code is already Apache-2.0 licensed and ASF-
  owned, so the moves go through the **standard ASF IP Clearance process**
  — no Software Grant Agreements are needed, since those apply only to
  code originating outside the ASF. The lineage is documented in
  [`MISSION.md` § Source and IP](../MISSION.md#source-and-ip).

- **No "tasked with migration" / "discharge" clauses** — those clauses are
  appropriate when a new PMC takes over an existing sub-project of an
  existing PMC, and the prior PMC is being relieved of responsibilities.
  Magpie is a fresh PMC with no existing PMC losing scope, so the clauses
  are correctly absent here.

- **Membership coordination** — the named roster must be cleared with
  `members@apache.org` and `secretary@apache.org` before the resolution
  goes to the agenda. The 22-member list above reflects MISSION.md's
  *"7 or more members"* size criterion and the diversity / developer-
  experience criteria in MISSION.md § Initial PMC composition.

- **PMC name vs. trademark review** — `MISSION.md` § Proposed Names lists
  four candidates (Magpie / Beacon / Guild / Lichen) pending parallel
  `trademarks@apache.org` review. The first to clear `trademarks@` becomes
  the final name. Replace "Magpie" in the resolution text above with
  whichever name is cleared before the resolution lands on the agenda.

- **Special Order number** — assigned by the Board Secretary when the
  agenda is built. Placeholder `[NN]` above.

- **Vote line** — `Unanimous` is the expected outcome but the Secretary
  records the actual result. Placeholder retained.

- **Supporting document attachment** — `MISSION.md` itself is the
  supporting document the Board reads alongside this resolution. Confirm
  it is included in the agenda packet under the proposing director's name.

- **Discussion about project's scope and mission** - can be found in the board@ mailing list archives,
starting with the initial proposal thread at https://lists.apache.org/thread/5zdgm9d55lzkhq6lx96dj5b699smbm1f
