# Issue management skill family

> **Scope.** Works on any project, ASF or not — no
> Apache-Software-Foundation-specific assumptions baked in.

Maintainer-facing skills for projects with a general-issue tracker
(JIRA, GitHub Issues, Bugzilla, GitLab Issues). Eight skills that
cover per-issue work, pool-level sweeps, deduplication, and
read-only reporting:

1. **Agentic Triage** — sweep open issues in the configured candidate pool,
   classify against the project's criteria, propose a disposition
   (BUG / FEATURE-REQUEST / NEEDS-INFO / DUPLICATE / INVALID /
   ALREADY-FIXED), execute on maintainer confirmation.
2. **Reassess** — sweep a configured pool of resolved or end-of-life
   issues and re-assess each against the current upstream codebase,
   surfacing silent fixes and partial fixes.
3. **Reproducer** — for a single issue identifying a code-level bug,
   extract the reporter's example code, adapt it to run on the
   current default branch, execute via the project's runtime, and
   compose a structured verdict. Read-only on the tracker.
4. **Fix-workflow** — for a triaged issue confirmed as a bug or
   feature, draft a fix PR (code change, regression test, commit
   message, PR description). Drafts only; the human committer
   reviews and pushes.
5. **Stale-sweep** — sweep open issues for inactivity past a
   configurable threshold, classify each as `REQUEST-UPDATE` (nudge)
   or `CLOSE-STALE` (pre-close notice), post one comment per issue on
   maintainer confirmation; closures require a second explicit
   confirmation step.
6. **Stats** — read-only dashboard over a directory of `verdict.json`
   files produced by reassess campaigns. Surfaces health rating,
   classification distribution, partial-fix surfaces, and per-component
   breakdowns.
7. **Deduplicate** — identify two open issues sharing the same root
   cause, draft a cross-link comment and a closing rationale, and
   close the duplicate on maintainer confirmation; closures require a
   second explicit confirmation step.
8. **Backlog stats** — read-only dashboard over the open issue
   backlog. Surfaces a health rating, prioritised recommendations,
   age and staleness breakdowns, area pressure ranking, and a
   triage-funnel summary without modifying any tracker state.

## Install & first runs

Install just this family — one plugin, 8 skills. General-issue lifecycle: triage, reproduction, dedup, backlog.

```text
/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie
/plugin install magpie-issue@apache-magpie
```

New to Magpie? The [quick start](../quick-start.md) walks the whole path in
one place — install, the first `/magpie-setup` run, and a recording of it
happening — plus the other agents and the secure-isolation setup to run next.

### The first run

The first time you call a skill in this family it checks whether the project is
set up, before it does anything else. On a project that has not been adopted it
stops right there and proposes `/magpie-setup`, rather than acting on
placeholders it cannot resolve:

![The magpie-issue family's first run — the skill's pre-flight finds no project config, stops and proposes /magpie-setup, then the same command succeeds on the retry](../../assets/quickstart/families/issue-first-run.svg)

That check is silent once the project is set up: it costs three file checks and
prints nothing.

### Try these first

*Illustrative shapes, not real transcripts — your output will differ. Nothing
below sends, merges, or posts anything without you confirming it.*

**Triage the new issues.**

```text
> /magpie-issue:triage

  #9021  bug, needs-repro     -> labels proposed
  #9022  duplicate of #8877   -> close comment drafted
  #9023  question             -> discussions, reply drafted
```

**Find the duplicates.**

```text
> /magpie-issue:deduplicate

  4 clusters in 312 open issues
  'OOM on large parquet' -> #7712 (keep) + #8109, #8330, #8901
```

**Try to reproduce one.**

```text
> /magpie-issue:reproducer

  #9021 on 3.2.1: reproduced (traceback matches)
         on main:  not reproduced -> fixed by #8990?
  Repro script written to /tmp/repro-9021.py
```

## Family boundary

This family sits **alongside** two related families:

- [`pr-management-*`](../pr-management/README.md) handles the
  pull-request queue (open PRs, code review, queue stats). PRs are
  not issues; the skills there operate on a different tracker
  surface and apply different criteria.
- [`security-issue-*`](../security/README.md) handles the security-
  issue tracker, with confidentiality and CVE-allocation constraints
  the general-issue family does not need. A project may use both
  families against different trackers (private security repo;
  public general-issue JIRA).

A maintainer of a project with both an issue tracker and an active
PR flow typically uses both `issue-*` and `pr-management-*` families,
configured with different trackers.

## Skills

| Skill | Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`issue-triage`](../../skills/issue-triage/SKILL.md) | Agentic Triage | Per-issue classification + disposition proposal |
| [`issue-reassess`](../../skills/issue-reassess/SKILL.md) | Agentic Triage | Pool-level sweep of resolved / EOL issues for re-assessment |
| [`issue-reproducer`](../../skills/issue-reproducer/SKILL.md) | — | Per-issue extraction + execution of code examples |
| [`issue-fix-workflow`](../../skills/issue-fix-workflow/SKILL.md) | Agentic Drafting | Drafts a fix PR for a triaged issue |
| [`issue-stale-sweep`](../../skills/issue-stale-sweep/SKILL.md) | Agentic Triage | Backlog hygiene: classifies dormant issues as `REQUEST-UPDATE` or `CLOSE-STALE`; posts one comment per issue on confirmation |
| [`issue-reassess-stats`](../../skills/issue-reassess-stats/SKILL.md) | — | Read-only campaign dashboard |
| [`issue-deduplicate`](../../skills/issue-deduplicate/SKILL.md) | Triage | Merge two open issues describing the same root cause; posts notices and closes the duplicate on explicit two-step confirmation |
| [`issue-backlog-stats`](../../skills/issue-backlog-stats/SKILL.md) | Triage | Read-only dashboard over the open issue backlog: health rating, area pressure, age breakdown, triage funnel, and staleness candidates |

`issue-reproducer` and `issue-reassess-stats` sit outside the MISSION
mode taxonomy; they are mechanical / read-only, not classificatory or
mutating.

## Adopter contract

The skills resolve project-specific content from these files in the
adopter's `<project-config>/` directory:

| File | Used by |
|---|---|
| [`project.md`](../../projects/_template/project.md) | all `issue-*` skills (identifiers, `upstream_default_branch`) |
| [`issue-tracker-config.md`](../../projects/_template/issue-tracker-config.md) | all `issue-*` skills (URL, project key, auth, default queries) |
| [`scope-labels.md`](../../projects/_template/scope-labels.md) | `issue-triage`, `issue-reassess`, `issue-backlog-stats` (component / area routing and area pressure ranking) |
| [`release-trains.md`](../../projects/_template/release-trains.md) | `issue-triage` (`@`-mention routing) |
| [`canned-responses.md`](../../projects/_template/canned-responses.md) | `issue-triage` (NEEDS-INFO templates) |
| [`runtime-invocation.md`](../../projects/_template/runtime-invocation.md) | `issue-reproducer` (how to invoke the project's runtime on extracted code) |
| [`reassess-pool-defaults.md`](../../projects/_template/reassess-pool-defaults.md) | `issue-reassess` (pool definitions extending the default queries in `issue-tracker-config.md`) |
| [`reproducer-conventions.md`](../../projects/_template/reproducer-conventions.md) | `issue-reproducer` (evidence-package directory layout) |
| [`stale-sweep-config.md`](../../projects/_template/stale-sweep-config.md) | `issue-stale-sweep`, `issue-backlog-stats` (warn / close / hard-close thresholds; omit to use framework defaults of 90 / 180 / 365 days) |

## Status

**Experimental.** No adopter pilot has run an evaluation against
this family yet. Shape may change between framework versions.

To provide pilot feedback, copy
[`docs/pilot-report-template.md`](../pilot-report-template.md) into your
project notes, fill in each section, and optionally validate the filled-in
report with:

```bash
uv run --project tools/pilot-report-validator pilot-report-validate <your-report.md>
```
