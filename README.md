# Apache Magpie

[![Magpie](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/magpie/main/assets/badge.json)](https://magpie.apache.org/)

**Adopt a Magpie.** Apache Magpie provides high-quality recipes for
agent-assisted software project maintenance.

These recipes allow human maintainers working with AIs to efficiently handle
the repetitive parts of running an open-source project: issue triage, PR
review, mentoring contributors, managing security reports, and more.

Magpie is currently in development for ASF projects + Python Core team
friendlies. Testers welcome!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The motivation, scope, and design commitments behind this work
> live in [`MISSION.md`](MISSION.md) — the founding mission of the
> Apache Magpie Top-Level Project, originally filed as its
> establishment proposal. Read that for the *why*; this README is
> the *how* once you've decided to install.

## Install

**Start here → [Quick start](docs/quick-start.md)** — two commands, in the
agent you already use.

```text
/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie              # Claude Code
/plugin install magpie-setup@apache-magpie         # always take this one
/plugin install magpie-pr-management@apache-magpie # + whichever families you need
```

Install **one plugin per family you actually want** — that keeps the always-on
context cost proportional (~0.2–2.0k tokens a family). The all-in-one
`magpie` plugin installs all 74 skills at ~8.6k always-on tokens and is **not
recommended** unless you genuinely need every family.

Codex, VS Code / Copilot, and Gemini are one-liners too — the
[quick start](docs/quick-start.md) has all four, plus what to run next to put
the agent in its sandbox. Nothing is committed to your repository.

**Fallback — the pinned snapshot install.** Use it when a marketplace is not
an option or not enough: your agent has no plugin mechanism, you need the
signed ASF source release rather than a git clone, or the project wants every
contributor and CI job pinned to one committed version with drift detection.

1. [Download / pin a release](https://magpie.apache.org/downloads/)
2. Set up the symlinks and git-ignores — see
   [`docs/setup/install-recipes.md`](docs/setup/install-recipes.md)
3. Ask your agent to complete the install: `/magpie-setup install`

The two are complementary, not exclusive.

## Usage

Magpie is used by interacting with your AI agents. You'll use plain-language
prompts like

> review PR #5193

or

> triage the latest security reports

or skill calls starting with a slash, like

> /magpie-repo-health:dependency-audit

(the family-plugin form, assuming the recommended marketplace install above —
see [Skill names differ by install method](docs/setup/marketplace.md#skill-names-differ-by-install-method)
if you're on the pinned-snapshot fallback instead).

## Update / maintain

**Marketplace install** (the recommended path above):

- `/plugin marketplace update apache-magpie` then
  `/plugin update <plugin>@apache-magpie` — refresh the marketplace
  metadata, then bump the installed plugin(s) to its latest.
- Add or drop families by installing or uninstalling their plugin —
  there is no separate "pick families" step once you're on a
  marketplace install.

**Pinned-snapshot install** (the fallback):

- `/magpie-setup upgrade` — refresh the snapshot to a newer
  framework version + reconcile any overrides against the new
  framework structure.
- `/magpie-setup verify` — read-only health check (snapshot
  intact, symlinks live, `.gitignore` correct, etc.).
- `/magpie-setup override <framework-skill>` — open or
  scaffold an override file for a framework skill.

## Skill families

The following skill families ship in the framework, all at `experimental` or
`stable`, and each skill declares its family in a `family:` frontmatter
key. On the recommended marketplace install, you choose families by which
per-family plugin(s) you install (see [Install](#install) above) — install
or uninstall a plugin at any time to add or drop a family. On the
pinned-snapshot fallback, `/magpie-setup` offers the **opt-in** families —
and the optional **MCP servers** (`ponymail`, `apache-projects`,
`gmail-plaintext`) — in a single install choice, and symlinks for the picked
families land in the skill directory. Either way, the two **always-on**
families (`setup`, `utilities`) are wired unconditionally and never prompted
for.

The **Modes** column maps each family to the MISSION agent-assistance
taxonomy — see [`docs/modes.md`](docs/modes.md) for what each mode
means and which modes are still proposed vs. shipping today.

| Family | Type | Modes | Purpose | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [**setup**](docs/setup/README.md) | always-on | (infra) | Isolated agent setup, framework install + maintenance, shared-config sync. The prerequisite — at minimum the `setup` skill itself runs out of this family. | 9 skills, [`docs/setup/`](docs/setup/) |
| **utilities** | always-on | (meta) | Framework meta-skills: author skills (`write-skill`), restructure them (`optimize-skill`), reconcile skill state (`skill-reconciler`), report framework issues (`report-framework-issue`), and print a live index (`list-skills`). | 5 skills |
| [**security**](docs/security/README.md) | opt-in | Triage, Drafting | 16-step security-issue handling lifecycle — from `security@` import through CVE publication, including state sync — plus producing, verifying, and maintaining the project's own security model. Maintainer-only. | 15 skills, [`docs/security/`](docs/security/) |
| [**pr-management**](docs/pr-management/README.md) | opt-in | Triage | Maintainer-facing PR-queue management — triage, stats, deep code review, express-lane merge, stale-sweep, reviewer routing, and pre-first-PR checks. | 8 skills, [`docs/pr-management/`](docs/pr-management/README.md) |
| [**issue**](docs/issue-management/README.md) | opt-in | Triage, Drafting | General-issue lifecycle: triage, reproduction, fix drafting, reassess, stale-sweep, deduplication, and backlog reporting. | 8 skills, [`docs/issue-management/`](docs/issue-management/README.md) |
| [**release-management**](docs/release-management/README.md) | opt-in | Triage, Drafting | 14-step ASF release lifecycle, planning issue, RC cut + sign, `[VOTE]` thread, tally, promote, `[ANNOUNCE]`, archive, audit log. Agent never holds the RM's signing key and never publishes the release. **Experimental**, all 10 skills shipped. | 10 skills, [`docs/release-management/`](docs/release-management/) |
| [**repo-health**](docs/repo-health/README.md) | opt-in | Triage | Read-only repository-health audits: obsolete runner labels, Actions workflow security, dependency vulnerabilities, dependency licence review, license/NOTICE compliance, flaky-test patterns, plus audit-finding fixes. | 7 skills, [`docs/repo-health/`](docs/repo-health/) |
| [**pairing**](docs/pairing/README.md) | opt-in | Pairing | Pair a change with a structured self-review or a multi-agent adversarial review before it lands. | 2 skills, [`docs/pairing/`](docs/pairing/README.md) |
| [**mentoring**](docs/mentoring/README.md) | opt-in | Mentoring | Newcomer-facing mentoring — first-contact welcome, newcomer-issue explanations, and good-first-issue authoring + backlog curation. **Experimental**. | 4 skills, [`docs/mentoring/`](docs/mentoring/README.md) |
| [**contributor-growth**](docs/contributor-growth/README.md) | opt-in | Triage, Mentoring | The path-to-committer track: activity sweeps, nomination briefs, contributor-sentiment signals, readiness tracking, and committer / post-vote onboarding. | 6 skills, [`docs/contributor-growth/`](docs/contributor-growth/README.md) |

### External skill sources

Skill families or individual skills can be pulled
from a **trusted external source** — a repo other than `apache/magpie` that
ships Magpie-shaped skills (with their evals and tests). Where a skill
directory would sit, a `skills/<name>/source.md` **redirect** names a
pinned, verified source the adopter has vouched for; `/magpie-setup` fetches
it into the gitignored snapshot and wires it in exactly like a framework
skill. Nothing is fetched unless the adopter commits the pin — see
[`docs/skill-sources/`](docs/skill-sources/README.md),
[`PRINCIPLES.md` §13](PRINCIPLES.md#13-snapshot-plus-override-never-vendored-copies),
and [`RFC-AI-0006`](docs/rfcs/RFC-AI-0006.md).

## Acknowledgements

Apache Magpie was first developed and proven inside **Apache Airflow**, and was
maintained for a time as the `apache/airflow-steward` repository under the
Airflow PMC before being renamed and established as its own project. It also
incorporates early skill work contributed by way of the **Apache Groovy**
community. All of that code carries the same rightsholder — Copyright The Apache
Software Foundation, under the Apache License 2.0 — so it is not a third-party
