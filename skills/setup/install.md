# install — first-time install of apache-magpie (alias: `adopt`)

The default sub-action when the user says "install magpie" or
"adopt apache-magpie".

**Route first: the marketplace install is the default.** Unless
the user named a snapshot method (`method:svn-zip` / `git-tag` /
`git-branch`) or `method:local`, this run takes
[Marketplace install](#marketplace-install--the-default-path) —
the agent's own plugin mechanism, nothing written to the repo —
and Steps 1–12 below never execute. The pinned snapshot install
those steps describe is the **fallback**, for the cases
[`SKILL.md` Golden rule 10](SKILL.md#golden-rules) enumerates:
an agent with no plugin mechanism, a project that needs the
signed ASF source artefact, or a project that wants every
contributor and CI job on one committed version pin.

On the **pinned-snapshot path** there are two adoption shapes the
skill recognises and routes between automatically:

- **Fresh adoption (no committed lock yet).** The first
  adopter on a project. Runs the full bootstrap: pick the
  install method, fetch the snapshot, write *both* lock
  files, wire up symlinks, scaffold overrides, install
  hooks, update docs.
- **Subsequent adoption (committed lock exists).** A new
  developer joining a project that already adopted. Reads
  `<committed-lock>` to know what to install, fetches per
  that pin, writes only the `<local-lock>`, refreshes
  symlinks. Skips the doc-update + interactive-prompt flow.

> **Note on the bootstrap recipe.** `setup` is **the
> only framework artefact an adopter commits**. Getting it
> *into* a fresh adopter repo is the chicken-and-egg the
> [install-recipes](../../docs/setup/install-recipes.md)
> doc resolves: copy-pasteable shell recipes per install
> method that fetch the snapshot + place the `setup`
> skill content + add `.gitignore` entries. Once that
> recipe runs and `setup` is on disk, the agent
> follows this file to finish adoption.

## Inputs

- `from:<git-ref>` / `from:<version>` — explicit ref or
  version (overrides the prompt). On the marketplace path it
  pins the marketplace to that tag.
- `method:<marketplace | git-branch | git-tag | svn-zip |
  local>` — explicit method. **Default: `marketplace`.** The
  three snapshot methods and `local` route into Steps 1–12;
  `marketplace` routes into
  [Marketplace install](#marketplace-install--the-default-path).
- `skill-families:<list>` — comma-separated **opt-in**
  families to symlink (default: prompt). Valid values are the
  opt-in families declared by `family:` keys in the snapshot:
  `security`, `pr-management`, `issue`, `release-management`,
  `repo-health`, `pairing`, `mentoring`, `contributor-growth`.
  The flag does **not** accept the always-on families (`setup`,
  `utilities`); per
  [`SKILL.md` Golden rule 8](SKILL.md#golden-rules) those
  are wired up unconditionally on every adopt run and the
  user is never asked about them.

## Marketplace install — the default path

The install path for every user whose agent has a plugin
mechanism. It puts the skills into **the agent**, per machine:
nothing committed, nothing gitignored, no snapshot fetched, no
lock file written, no symlink created, no post-checkout hook. It
therefore has no fresh-vs-subsequent shape, no main-checkout
restriction, and no dependency on the repo having adopted
anything — it runs in a worktree, and in a repo the user does not
own.

Per-agent reference (every supported client, pinning, updates):
[`docs/setup/marketplace.md`](../../docs/setup/marketplace.md).

### Step M1 — Is Magpie already plugin-installed?

Check before proposing anything, so a second install is never
stacked on a working one:

- **This skill's own location settles it.** If the file you are
  reading resolves under a plugin cache
  (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/<plugin>/…`), or
  `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` / `PLUGIN_ROOT` is set in the
  environment, Magpie is already installed as a plugin.
- **Claude Code** — `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`
  and `~/.claude/plugins/known_marketplaces.json` name the
  installed plugins and whether the `apache-magpie` marketplace
  is registered.
- **Codex CLI** — `codex plugin list`. **Gemini CLI** —
  `gemini extensions list`.

If it is installed: report which plugins are active and their
version, offer to **add** any family the user now wants (same
`plugin install` command, different family), and give the update
commands from [Step M5](#step-m5--recap-and-what-comes-next).
Do not re-run the install.

Also check for the *other* path already being live in this repo:
a `.apache-magpie.lock` at the repo root means the project is on
the pinned snapshot install. Say so, and do not add a marketplace
install silently on top of it — the double-install trap in
[`SKILL.md` Golden rule 10](SKILL.md#golden-rules).

### Step M2 — Identify the agent

| Agent | Detect it by | Marketplace |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/` present; `CLAUDE_*` env; the session itself | `/plugin` |
| OpenAI Codex CLI | `codex` on `PATH`, `~/.codex/` | `codex plugin` |
| VS Code / GitHub Copilot | `.vscode/`, the Copilot CLI on `PATH` | repo URL or catalog |
| Google Gemini CLI | `gemini` on `PATH`, `~/.gemini/` | `gemini extensions` |
| Cursor, `microsoft/apm`, Kiro, OpenCode | per [`marketplace.md`](../../docs/setup/marketplace.md#supported-agents) | varies |

When the running agent is ambiguous, ask — one structured
question, not a guess: the commands differ per client and a wrong
one wastes the user's turn.

**If the agent has no plugin mechanism at all** — the clients
[`marketplace.md`](../../docs/setup/marketplace.md#not-supported)
lists as unsupported, Windsurf and Goose among them — say so
plainly, name it as the reason, and hand off to the pinned
snapshot install at [Step 0](#step-0--pre-flight). That — not a
preference — is what the snapshot path is for.

### Step M3 — Pick the families

Ask which **skill families** the user wants, and install one
plugin per family. Prefer the harness's structured-question tool
(Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion`), multi-select, one option per
family, each described by the problem it solves — the table in
[`docs/quick-start.md`](../../docs/quick-start.md#what-each-family-solves)
is the source text.

Two rules for the recommendation:

- **`magpie-setup` is always in the pick** — it carries the
  secure-isolation skills of
  [Step M5](#step-m5--recap-and-what-comes-next) and this skill
  itself.
- **Recommend per-family plugins over the all-in-one `magpie`.**
  Each installed skill advertises its name and description to
  the model on *every* turn, so the all-in-one's 74 skills cost
  ~8.6k always-on tokens whether or not a Magpie skill is used
  that turn; a family is ~0.2k–2.0k. Take the all-in-one only
  when the user genuinely wants every family, is on Windows
  without symlink support, or is on an agent where the family
  plugins are unavailable — they are **Claude Code only**;
  Codex, Copilot and the rest install `magpie`.

If the user passed `skill-families:<list>`, use it verbatim and
skip the prompt.

### Step M4 — Emit the commands

**The user runs these, not the agent.** A `/plugin …` command is
a client command typed in the session — no tool can invoke it —
so print the exact block and let the user fire it. Shell-based
clients (Codex, Gemini) *can* be run for the user, with
confirmation, but printing them is equally fine.

Claude Code, one line per family the user picked:

```text
/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie
/plugin install magpie-setup@apache-magpie
/plugin install magpie-<family>@apache-magpie
```

Codex CLI:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add apache/magpie
codex plugin install magpie
```

Gemini CLI:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/apache/magpie
```

VS Code / Copilot: point the plugin install at
`https://github.com/apache/magpie`.

To pin a version instead of tracking `main`, add the marketplace
from the tag — `/plugin marketplace add apache/magpie@<version>`
— which is what `from:<version>` means on this path.

Skills are then invoked under the plugin namespace:
`/magpie-<family>:<skill>` (family plugin) or `/magpie:<skill>`
(all-in-one) — **not** the `/magpie-<skill>` form the snapshot
install produces
([`marketplace.md`](../../docs/setup/marketplace.md#skill-names-differ-by-install-method)).

### Step M5 — Recap and what comes next

Tell the user, in this order:

1. **What landed** — which plugins, which agent, tracking `main`
   or pinned to `<version>`.
2. **Run the secure-agent setup next** — `setup-isolated-setup-install`.
   The marketplace install delivers skills; it does not sandbox
   the agent, and the framework's other skills run against
   pre-disclosure security content. This is the one follow-up
   that is not optional.
3. **How it updates** — Claude Code:
   `/plugin marketplace update apache-magpie` then
   `/plugin update <plugin>@apache-magpie`; Codex:
   `codex plugin update magpie`; Gemini:
   `gemini extensions update magpie`. The bundled `SessionStart`
   hook prompts on a version change where the client runs hooks.
4. **What this install deliberately does not set up**, each with
   the one thing that would change the answer:
   - the **committed version pin** and drift detection — add the
     [pinned snapshot install](#step-0--pre-flight) when the
     project wants every contributor and CI job on one version;
   - **personal overrides** — `.apache-magpie-local/` works in any
     repo, adopted or not, once a single `.gitignore` line exists.
     Say where that line goes and leave adding it to the user: it is
     theirs to put in the repo's `.gitignore` or in their own global
     excludes, and that choice is not yours to make for them.
5. **This install wrote nothing to the repo, and that is the finished
   state.** A marketplace install touches only this machine's agent.
   Say so plainly: there is no repo-side step left undone, and the
   install is not partial, pending, or awaiting anything.

   If the user is a maintainer who wants contributors to arrive with a
   recommended set already enabled, that is **adoption** — a separate
   decision that commits files for everyone — and it is
   [`adopt.md`](adopt.md). Mention it only if they ask, or if they say
   something that means it ("set this up for the team", "so everyone
   gets it"). Do not offer it as a follow-up to an install: an install
   is complete on its own, and proposing a committed change to a repo
   the user may not maintain is not a default.

Then stop. Do not continue into Step 0.

## Step 0 — Pre-flight

**This pre-flight is the snapshot path's.** The marketplace path
has its own, lighter one (it needs no git repo, and runs in a
worktree just as well as in the main checkout) — see
[Marketplace install](#marketplace-install--the-default-path).
Reach Step 0 only when the user named a snapshot method, or when
the marketplace path handed off here because the agent has no
plugin mechanism.

1. Confirm we are in a git repo (`git rev-parse
   --show-toplevel`).
2. **Confirm we are in the main checkout, not a git worktree.**
   Compare `git rev-parse --git-dir` against
   `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` — they are equal in the
   main checkout and different in a worktree. If different,
   stop with:

   > *"`adopt` runs in the main checkout, not a worktree. From
   > the main: `cd <main-path> && setup`. To wire this
   > worktree up after adoption lands in the main, use
   > `setup worktree-init`."*

   The main's path is
   `$(dirname "$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" && pwd)")` —
   surface it explicitly in the error message so the operator
   can `cd` there without guessing.
3. Detect whether we are **in the Apache Magpie framework
   checkout itself** rather than an adopter repo. The framework
   checkout is the one place self-adoption is possible — it
   links its own `skills/` source directly instead of fetching a
   snapshot (see
   [Local self-adoption](#local-self-adoption-methodlocal)).

   Detect it **structurally** — do *not* rely on the `origin`
   URL, which on a contributor's fork points at
   `<user>/magpie`, not `apache/`. The repo is the
   framework checkout when `skills/setup/SKILL.md` exists at the
   repo root with `name: magpie-setup` in its frontmatter **and**
   `skills/list-skills/` is present.

   - **Framework checkout** → self-adoption is available. If the
     user passed `method:local`, go straight to
     [Local self-adoption](#local-self-adoption-methodlocal).
     Otherwise offer it — the only non-circular adoption for the
     framework repo is the local one (a remote snapshot of the
     framework into itself would shadow the live `skills/`
     source with a stale copy). On confirmation, follow that
     section; a remote `method:` against the framework checkout
     is refused.
   - **Adopter repo** (the structural markers are absent) →
     continue with the normal remote-snapshot flow below.
4. Compute the **active target set** per
   [`agents.md`](agents.md): the always-on neutral targets
   (`universal` = `.agents/skills/`, the canonical home; plus
   the `claude-code` + `github` relay pair), any other registry
   dir already present in the repo, and any `agents:<list>`
   opt-in. **`.agents/skills/` is always canonical** — its
   `magpie-*` entries are the links into the snapshot; every
   other active target gets per-skill relay symlinks into it.

   There is **no skills-dir convention to detect**: regardless
   of how the adopter previously organised `.claude/skills/` or
   `.github/skills/`, the framework always wires the `magpie-*`
   set the same way (canonical in `.agents/skills/`, relayed
   elsewhere) and leaves the adopter's own native (non-`magpie-`)
   skills in place. Pin `.agents/skills/` as the canonical dir
   for the rest of this flow.

## Local self-adoption (`method:local`)

**Framework checkout only.** When `setup` runs inside the
Apache Magpie framework checkout (detected in
[Step 0](#step-0--pre-flight)), it adopts the framework *into
itself* by linking the live `skills/` source directly — **no
remote URL, no snapshot fetch, no repo copy**. This is how a
maintainer makes the framework's own skills callable while
developing the framework. An adopter repo never reaches this
section; it runs Steps 1–12 below.

How it differs from a remote adoption:

- **No `<snapshot-dir>`.** Nothing is fetched — the skill sources
  already live in `skills/` at the repo root.
- **No remote lock.** A single committed marker file
  `.apache-magpie.lock` records `method: local` (no
  `url`/`ref`/`commit`/`sha512`), and there is no
  `.apache-magpie.local.lock`.
- **Symlinks are committed, not gitignored.** Each
  `magpie-<skill>` symlink targets `../../skills/<skill>/` — an
  in-repo path that always resolves on a fresh clone — so the
  links are committed. They are written under **every active
  target dir** ([`agents.md`](agents.md)) — `.agents/skills/`
  (the universal path shared by Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI,
  Copilot, …), `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code), and
  `.github/skills/` (GitHub's skill loader) — so the framework's
  own skills are discoverable by any harness; `.gitignore`
  un-ignores `magpie-*` in each. Every contributor gets the
  skills active with no setup step, whatever agent they use.
- **All skills, no family prompt.** Self-adoption links *every*
  skill under `skills/`, so the opt-in family prompt of
  [Step 5](#step-5--pick-the-skill-families-and-mcp-servers) is skipped.
  `skill-families:` is still honoured if the maintainer wants to
  narrow the set.
- **`magpie-setup` is itself a symlink** (→ `../../skills/setup/`),
  not a committed copy. The copy-vs-symlink rule of
  [`SKILL.md` Golden rule 6](SKILL.md#golden-rules) exists only
  because adopter snapshots disappear on clone; the framework's
  own source is always present, so the bootstrap is linked like
  every other skill.

### Steps

1. **Pre-flight** ([Step 0](#step-0--pre-flight)) has confirmed
   we are in the framework checkout and in the main checkout (not
   a worktree).
2. **Refuse a remote method.** If the user passed
   `method:git-branch|git-tag|svn-zip`, stop: a remote snapshot
   of the framework into itself is circular and would shadow the
   live `skills/` source.
3. **Enumerate skills.** List every directory under
   `<repo-root>/skills/` that contains a `SKILL.md`. Apply
   `skill-families:` as a filter if it was passed; otherwise take
   all of them.
4. **Write the marker lock** at `<repo-root>/.apache-magpie.lock`:

   ```text
   # .apache-magpie.lock — committed. Local self-adoption marker.
   # The framework checkout links its own skills/ source; there is
   # no remote snapshot. Edited only by setup.

   method: local
   source: skills/
   ```

5. **`.gitignore`.** Ensure each skills dir glob is ignored with
   the `magpie-*` set un-ignored, in **every active target
   location** ([`agents.md`](agents.md) — the always-on neutral
   targets `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`
   plus any other registry dir already present). Idempotent — add
   any missing line. For the default set:

   ```text
   .agents/skills/*
   !/.agents/skills/magpie-*
   .claude/skills/*
   !/.claude/skills/magpie-*
   .github/skills/*
   !/.github/skills/magpie-*
   ```

   (Self-adoption symlinks are *committed*, not gitignored — see
   the next step — so the `!…/magpie-*` negation here un-ignores
   the whole set, not just `magpie-setup`.)

6. **Create the symlinks** (canonical first, then relays). For
   each enumerated skill `<n>`:
   - **Canonical** — create `.agents/skills/magpie-<n>` →
     `../../skills/<n>` (the in-repo source).
   - **Relays** — for every *other* active target dir from
     [`agents.md`](agents.md) (`.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`,
     plus any present holdout), create `magpie-<n>` →
     `../../.agents/skills/magpie-<n>` (pointing back at the
     canonical entry).

   Idempotent: re-point a pre-existing `magpie-<n>` symlink only
   if it targets something else; never overwrite a non-symlink
   (surface the conflict and stop). Show the full list and
   confirm before writing.
7. **Verify + stage.** Confirm every canonical `magpie-<n>`
   symlink resolves to a directory containing `SKILL.md`, and
   every relay resolves through `.agents/skills/magpie-<n>` to the
   same, then suggest the user `git add` the symlinks,
   `.apache-magpie.lock`, and `.gitignore`.

Self-adoption skips the adopter-only steps entirely: no snapshot
fetch (Step 3), no committed-`setup` reconcile (Step 3b), no
fit-signal probe (Step 4b), no family prompt (Step 5), no
`.apache-magpie-overrides/` scaffold (Step 9), no `user.md`
(Step 9b), no comdev MCP prereqs (Step 9c), no project-doc
updates (Step 11) — the framework repo *is* the documentation.

## Step 1 — Detect adoption shape

```text
if .apache-magpie.lock exists:
    → SUBSEQUENT adoption
elif .apache-magpie/ exists (snapshot only):
    → manual recipe was run; finish bootstrap (write committed
      lock from the recipe's choices, then continue as FRESH
      from Step 5)
else:
    → FRESH adoption
```

## Step 2 — Pick the snapshot fetch method (FRESH only)

Reaching this step means the run is already on the fallback
path — the user named a snapshot method, or
[Step M2](#step-m2--identify-the-agent) handed off because the
agent has no marketplace. What is left to choose is **where the
snapshot comes from**, not whether to take a snapshot at all.

If the user passed `method:` and `from:` flags, use those
verbatim. Otherwise, prompt:

| Method | When | Reproducibility |
|---|---|---|
| `svn-zip` | Production, and any adopter who needs the signed ASF source artefact | Frozen by version |
| `git-tag` | Pin a specific tag | Frozen by tag |
| `git-branch` | Track a branch tip (default: `main`) | Tracks tip — best during pre-release |

**Prefer structured Q&A.** When the agent harness offers a
structured-question tool (e.g. Claude Code's
`AskUserQuestion`), use it for this prompt rather than free-
form chat — single-select, three options, label = method
name, description = the *When* + *Reproducibility* cells
combined, recommend `git-branch` while the framework is in
its pre-release phase. Free-form chat is the fallback when
the harness has no structured-Q&A tool.

**One check before the fetch.** If the user landed here by
preference rather than necessity — their agent *does* have a
marketplace and nothing in the repo pins a version — say once
what the snapshot buys them (a committed pin, drift detection,
the signed artefact) and what it costs (a gitignored snapshot to
maintain, an upgrade sub-action to run, `magpie-*` symlinks in
every agent target dir), and confirm they want it. If they only
wanted the skills, the marketplace install is one command and
this whole flow is unnecessary. Take their answer either way and
do not ask twice.

The verbatim shell that fetches per each method is in
[`docs/setup/install-recipes.md`](../../docs/setup/install-recipes.md).
The skill at this point can either:

- Tell the user "your manual recipe already ran — please
  confirm the method you used, I will record it in the
  committed lock", or
- Run the per-method fetch itself if `<snapshot-dir>` does
  not yet exist.

For a SUBSEQUENT adoption (committed lock present), skip the
prompt entirely — re-use the method/url/ref from the
committed lock.

## Step 3 — Fetch the snapshot (if not already on disk)

Per the chosen method (FRESH) or per the committed lock
(SUBSEQUENT):

- **`git-branch`**: `git clone --depth=1 --branch <ref> <url>
  .apache-magpie`
- **`git-tag`**: `git clone --depth=1 --branch <tag> <url>
  .apache-magpie`. After clone, capture the resolved commit
  SHA for `<committed-lock>` (FRESH only).
- **`svn-zip`**: `curl` the zip + `.sha512` + `.asc`,
  verify, `unzip` to `.apache-magpie/`. Re-fetch
  verification details into `<committed-lock>` (FRESH only).

**Sandboxed agents:** for the `git-branch` / `git-tag` methods
the clone writes the snapshot's nested `.apache-magpie/.git/`,
which is in Claude Code's git-internals write-deny set, so the
clone fails with `operation not permitted`. Only the local
`.git/` write is blocked (the fetch host is allowlisted) —
propose a sandbox bypass to the operator before cloning.

If `<snapshot-dir>/` already exists with content, skip the
fetch — the recipe ran first and left the snapshot in place.

After the fetch (or skip), confirm
`<snapshot-dir>/skills/` lists the framework skills (e.g.
`pr-management-*`, `security-*`, `issue-*`, `release-*`,
`setup-*`, `list-skills`, `write-skill`) and that each
`SKILL.md` carries a `family:` frontmatter key. If not, the
fetch produced an unexpected layout — surface and stop.

## Step 3b — Reconcile the committed `setup` with the new snapshot + reload in-flight

Per [`SKILL.md` Golden rule 9](SKILL.md#golden-rules), the
adopter-side committed `setup` skill must match the
snapshot's version before the rest of this run executes —
otherwise we finish adoption against the *old* bootstrap
logic for a *new* framework version.

1. Diff the canonical committed copy
   `.agents/skills/magpie-setup/` against
   `.apache-magpie/skills/setup/`.
2. If they match — skip the rest of this step.
3. If they differ and the adopter has **no** local
   modifications beyond what the snapshot ships — overwrite
   the canonical committed copy from the snapshot:

   ```bash
   rm -rf .agents/skills/magpie-setup
   cp -r .apache-magpie/skills/setup \
         .agents/skills/magpie-setup
   ```

   The relay symlinks (`.claude/skills/magpie-setup`,
   `.github/skills/magpie-setup`) point at
   `../../.agents/skills/magpie-setup` and need no change.

4. If the adopter **does** have local modifications,
   surface the diff and stop. The user either (a) confirms
   the local mods can be discarded, (b) upstreams them as a
   PR to `apache/magpie` first, or (c) defers the
   bootstrap-skill refresh — in (c) the rest of this run
   continues against the in-flight (older) version with a
   warning.
5. **Reload in-flight.** Immediately after the copy lands,
   re-read `.agents/skills/magpie-setup/SKILL.md`
   and `.agents/skills/magpie-setup/install.md` (the
   current sub-action file), plus any helper file already
   open in this run (`agents.md`, `overrides.md`),
   before continuing to Step 4. The remaining steps run
   against the just-loaded content.

For a FRESH adoption where the bootstrap recipe placed the
matching `setup` content on disk before this skill
was invoked, the diff in (1) is empty and this step is a
no-op. For a SUBSEQUENT adoption against an old committed
copy, the overwrite + reload is the common case.

## Step 4 — Write `<committed-lock>` (FRESH only)

Create `<repo-root>/.apache-magpie.lock`:

```text
# .apache-magpie.lock — committed; the project's pin.
# Edited only by setup; do not modify by hand.

method: <method>
url:    <url>

# Per-method fields:
ref:    <branch | tag | version>
# git-tag: also `commit: <SHA>`
# svn-zip: also `sha512: <hash>`
```

## Step 4b — Read fit signals (FRESH only)

Before prompting for opt-in families in Step 5, refine the
pre-selection default by reading a few cheap signals from the
adopter repo. This step is **best-effort and time-boxed**:
its output is a *default* for Step 5, never a decision.

Skip the whole step (and fall back to the prose-named or
opt-out defaults of Step 5) when any of the following holds:

- the user already passed `skill-families:` (their flag wins);
- `gh` is missing, not authenticated, or the repo's `origin`
  / `upstream` is not a GitHub remote;
- any individual call below errors or exceeds ~5 s — treat
  the missing signal as zero and continue, do not retry.

Pick the canonical remote: prefer `upstream` over `origin`
when both exist; otherwise use whichever is present. Extract
`OWNER/REPO` from its URL.

**Volume signals** (each call gated by the rules above):

- open issues: `gh issue list --repo OWNER/REPO --state open
  --limit 1000 --json number | jq length`
- open PRs: `gh pr list --repo OWNER/REPO --state open
  --limit 1000 --json number | jq length`
- security-labeled open issues: same as above with `--label
  security`; missing label → 0.
- oldest open PR age in days: `gh pr list --repo OWNER/REPO
  --state open --json createdAt --jq '[.[].createdAt] | min'`
  then `(today − that date)`.
- 30-day merge ratio: opened-in-last-30d vs merged-in-last-30d
  via `gh pr list --search "created:>=YYYY-MM-DD"` and
  `--search "merged:>=YYYY-MM-DD"`; ratio = merged / opened,
  guard divide-by-zero.

**Track signals** (filesystem, free):

- `SECURITY.md` (any case) present at repo root.
- `.asf.yaml` present at repo root.

**Recommendation rules** (suggestion, never auto-decision):

- `security` if `SECURITY.md` is present **or** the
  security-labeled count is `> 0`.
- `pr-management` if open PRs `>= 5` **or** oldest open PR
  age `>= 30` days **or** 30-day merge ratio `< 0.5`.
- `issue` if open issues `>= 10` **or** oldest open issue age
  `>= 60` days (compute the second only if cheap).

Store the union of triggered families as
`<signal-derived-families>` for Step 5 to consume. If none
triggered, `<signal-derived-families>` is the empty set and
Step 5's fallback default applies.

**Auto-sourced metadata fields** (run when `gh` and/or `.asf.yaml` are
available). These pre-populate `<project-config>/project.md` in Step 9:

- **Organization-agnostic** — for *any* adopter, sourced from GitHub
  repository metadata (never from `.asf.yaml`):
  - `upstream_repo`: the repository's GitHub owner/name. Prefer `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner` when authenticated, or parse the git remote.
  - `upstream_default_branch`: from `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name`.
  - `product_family_url`: from `gh repo view --json homepage --jq .homepage`.
  - `labels`: from the list of repository topics via `gh repo view --json topics --jq .topics[].name`.

- **ASF-specific** — apply this block **only when `organization: ASF`** (a
  `.asf.yaml` at the repo root corroborates the ASF profile). **Skip it
  entirely for `independent` or any other non-ASF organization**: those
  projects have no `.asf.yaml` and their mailing lists do not follow the
  `*.apache.org` convention, so leave these fields as `TODO` for the
  adopter to fill rather than inventing `apache.org` addresses.
  - Mailing lists (`dev_list`, `commits_list`, `users_list`, `private_list`, `security_list`, `announce_list`): parse the `.asf.yaml` `notifications:` block if present:
    - `commits_list` is the target of the `commits` or `pullrequests` notification.
    - `dev_list` is the target of the `dev` or `issues` or `pullrequests` notification containing `dev@`. If not found, default to `dev@<project>.apache.org`.
    - `users_list` is the target of the `users` notification, or defaults to `users@<project>.apache.org`.
    - `security_list` defaults to `security@<project>.apache.org`.
    - `private_list` defaults to `private@<project>.apache.org`.
    - `announce_list` defaults to `announce@apache.org`.
  - `github.homepage` in `.asf.yaml` may refine `product_family_url` if the GitHub repo homepage was empty.

- If a value cannot be found, fall back to prompting during the scaffolding step.

## Step 5 — Pick the skill families and MCP servers

This is the **single install choice**: which opt-in skill
families to wire up, **and** which MCP servers to register.
Both are collected here so the operator picks everything
installable in one prompt; the MCP picks are then walked
through their install in Steps 9c / 9d and reflected in the
Step 9b `user.md` `tools` blocks.

**Compute the family set from the snapshot, not from a hard-coded
list.** Walk `<snapshot-dir>/skills/*/SKILL.md`, read each skill's
`family:` frontmatter key, and group. Never infer a family from the
skill-name prefix — `repo-health`, `contributor-growth`, and
`mentoring` span several prefixes (per
[`SKILL.md` Golden rule 8](SKILL.md#golden-rules)).

**Always-on (no prompt):** the `setup` family (every
`family: setup` skill except the bootstrap `setup` itself) and
the `utilities` family (`list-skills`, `write-skill`,
`optimize-skill`, `skill-reconciler`). These are wired
unconditionally, cannot be opted out via `skill-families:`, and
are **not** recorded in the lock files. Do **not** offer them as
selectable options.

**Opt-in families** = every family present in the snapshot minus
the always-on two. Today, with a one-line purpose each (counts
come from the snapshot, do not hard-code them):

- **`security`** — the security-issue handling lifecycle
  (import → triage → CVE → sync). Maintainer-only; needs a
  security tracker.
- **`pr-management`** — maintainer-facing PR-queue work: triage,
  deep code review, stats, express-lane merge, stale-sweep,
  reviewer routing, pre-first-PR checks.
- **`issue`** — general-issue tracker lifecycle: triage,
  reproduce, fix-workflow, reassess, stale-sweep, deduplicate,
  backlog stats. For a general-issue tracker (JIRA, GitHub
  Issues, Bugzilla, GitLab) that is *not* the security tracker.
  See [`docs/issue-management/README.md`](../../docs/issue-management/README.md).
- **`release-management`** — the ASF release lifecycle: prepare,
  RC cut + sign, `[VOTE]`, tally, promote, `[ANNOUNCE]`, archive,
  audit. Release-Manager-facing; the agent never holds the
  signing key. See [`docs/release-management/README.md`](../../docs/release-management/README.md).
- **`repo-health`** — read-only repository-health audits: CI
  runner labels, Actions workflow security, dependency
  vulnerabilities, license/NOTICE compliance, flaky tests, and
  audit-finding fixes. See [`docs/repo-health/README.md`](../../docs/repo-health/README.md).
- **`pairing`** — pair a change with a structured self-review or
  a multi-agent adversarial review. See [`docs/pairing/README.md`](../../docs/pairing/README.md).
- **`mentoring`** — newcomer-facing: first-contact welcome,
  newcomer-issue explainer, good-first-issue authoring and
  backlog curation. See [`docs/mentoring/README.md`](../../docs/mentoring/README.md).
- **`contributor-growth`** — the path-to-committer track:
  activity sweep, nomination brief, sentiment signals, readiness
  tracking, committer / post-vote onboarding. See
  [`docs/contributor-growth/README.md`](../../docs/contributor-growth/README.md).

**MCP servers** (folded into the same choice — read
[Step 9b](#step-9b--scaffold-usermd-fresh-only)'s `tools` contract for the
detail; install is walked in [Step 9c](#step-9c--comdev-mcp-prerequisites-asf-projects)
/ [Step 9d](#step-9d--gmail-plaintext-mcp-optional-gmail-drafters)):

- **`ponymail`** — read the ASF mailing-list archives (the
  primary mail-read backend for the security / release families;
  Gmail is the fallback). **ASF projects: mandatory** — the
  `_template` manifest declares it `mandatory: yes`.
- **`apache-projects`** — read-only ASF rosters / people /
  releases metadata (used by `contributor-nomination` and the
  security roster paths). **ASF projects: mandatory.**
- **`gmail-plaintext`** — create plain-text Gmail drafts with no
  tracking redirects (for operators who draft mail from the
  agent). Optional; not ASF-gated.

**Prefer structured Q&A.** When the harness offers a
structured-question tool, use **one** *multi-select* prompt with
two labelled groups — "Skill families" (the opt-in families
above) and "MCP servers" (the three above). None are mutually
exclusive. Pre-selection:

- *Families* — pre-tick the **union** of (a) families the user
  named in their initial "adopt" request (e.g. *"adopt for PR
  triage"* → `pr-management`, *"for releases"* →
  `release-management`) and (b) `<signal-derived-families>` from
  Step 4b. State in the prompt body why each is pre-ticked so the
  operator can untick what does not fit. If both sources are
  empty, pre-tick nothing and let the operator choose.
- *MCP servers* — for an ASF project (detected per
  [Step 9c](#step-9c--comdev-mcp-prerequisites-asf-projects)),
  pre-tick `ponymail` and `apache-projects` and label them
  **required**; pre-tick `gmail-plaintext` only if the operator
  selected a mail-drafting family (`security` or
  `release-management`). For a non-ASF project, pre-tick nothing.

SUBSEQUENT adoption: re-use the opt-in families recorded in
`<committed-lock>` / `<local-lock>` and the already-registered
MCP servers (inspect the session tool list for `mcp__ponymail__*`
/ `mcp__apache-projects__*` / `mcp__gmail-plaintext__*`); only
re-prompt for what is neither locked nor registered. If
`skill-families:` was passed, use those values verbatim for the
family set (the flag does not carry MCP picks — confirm those
separately). Free-form chat is the fallback when no structured
tool is available; keep the same two-group structure.

Record the family picks for Step 6 (the lock) and Step 8 (the
symlink wiring), and the MCP picks for Steps 9b–9d.

## Step 6 — Write `<local-lock>`

Always written, both FRESH and SUBSEQUENT. Records what
this machine fetched.

```text
# .apache-magpie.local.lock — gitignored; per-machine.

source_method:    <method>
source_url:       <url>
source_ref:       <ref>
fetched_commit:   <commit SHA — for git-branch and git-tag>
fetched_at:       <ISO-8601 timestamp>
```

## Step 7 — `.gitignore` entries (FRESH only)

The bootstrap recipe wrote these already; this step is
idempotent — re-add them if they're missing.

**Base entries — always needed**:

```text
/.apache-magpie
/.apache-magpie.local.lock
/.apache-magpie-local/
/.apache-magpie-sources
/.apache-magpie.sources.local.lock
/.claude/settings.local.json
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

`/.apache-magpie` and `/.apache-magpie-sources` carry **no trailing
slash** on purpose. In the main checkout both are directories, but
[`worktree-init`](worktree-init.md#step-1--create-the-snapshot-symlink)
replaces each with a **symlink** to the main checkout's copy so every
worktree shares one framework state. A `dir/`-style pattern matches
only directories, so a trailing slash would leave both entries
untracked-but-not-ignored in every worktree — `git status` noise, and
one `git add -A` away from committing a machine-local absolute-path
symlink. Without the slash the pattern matches the directory, its
contents, and the symlink alike, so the main checkout is unaffected.

The `/.apache-magpie-sources/` and
`/.apache-magpie.sources.local.lock` lines keep the gitignored
fetch of every [trusted external skill
source](../../docs/skill-sources/README.md) and its per-machine
fetch fingerprint out of the tree — the source counterpart of
`/.apache-magpie/` + `/.apache-magpie.local.lock`. The committed
per-source pins (`.apache-magpie.sources.lock`) are **not** ignored;
they travel with the repo like `<committed-lock>`. These two lines
are harmless when the adopter trusts no source (the paths simply
never appear); [`skill-sources.md`](skill-sources.md) also adds
them idempotently the first time a source is pinned on an older
adoption.

The `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc` lines (non-anchored — they match at
any depth) keep the byte-compiled artefacts that framework skill
scripts emit when run from the adopter checkout (e.g.
[`setup-status/scripts/collect_status.py`](../setup-status/scripts/collect_status.py))
out of the tree. Most adopters already carry these from a stock
Python `.gitignore`; the install flow adds them if missing.

There is deliberately **no** `/.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py` line.
The deterministic `PreToolUse` guard
([`tools/agent-guard`](../../tools/agent-guard/README.md)) is no
longer copied into the adopter tree: its `hooks.PreToolUse` wiring
in `.claude/settings.local.json` (above) resolves the engine inside
the snapshot, and skill-owned guards are discovered where they live.
Nothing repository-local exists to ignore, and — because the
snapshot is shared by every worktree via the
[`worktree-init` Step 1 symlink](worktree-init.md#step-1--create-the-snapshot-symlink)
— nothing has to be seeded per worktree either.

An adopter upgrading from a version that *did* install the copy
should delete the leftover `.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py` and
`.claude/hooks/guards.d/` (and drop the two `.gitignore` lines);
[`upgrade`](upgrade.md#step-6b--sync-locally-installed-hooks-and-configuration)
reports them. An adopter who keeps their own non-framework guards
outside the framework tree points `$MAGPIE_GUARD_DIRS` at them.

**Symlink entries — one uniform block per active target
([`agents.md`](agents.md)), no per-layout variation.** Every
framework skill is symlinked under the `magpie-` prefix (see
[`SKILL.md` Golden rule 6](SKILL.md#golden-rules)), so a single
`magpie-*` glob covers them all in each target dir — no per-family
lines. The canonical target (`.agents/skills/`) and every relay
target (`.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, any present holdout)
get the **same** two-line block, keyed on the target's own dir:

```text
/.agents/skills/magpie-*
!/.agents/skills/magpie-setup
/.claude/skills/magpie-*
!/.claude/skills/magpie-setup
/.github/skills/magpie-*
!/.github/skills/magpie-setup
```

Add the analogous two lines for any present holdout
(`.windsurf/skills/`, `.goose/skills/`, …). The relay symlinks are
gitignored exactly like the canonical ones: a relay points at
`../../.agents/skills/magpie-<n>`, which itself targets the
gitignored snapshot, so it dangles on a fresh clone before
`setup` runs.

The `magpie-*` glob covers every symlinked framework skill —
the opt-in families and the always-on `setup` / `utilities`
families alike (per
[`SKILL.md` Golden rule 8](SKILL.md#golden-rules)); every
symlinked framework skill is gitignored on every adopter
regardless of the opt-in family pick. The committed
`magpie-setup` skill is kept tracked by the
`!/.../magpie-setup` negation line in each block above —
without it the `magpie-*` glob would ignore the bootstrap and
a plain `git add` would silently skip it, leaving fresh clones
with no committed framework skill. It is the one copied
framework skill.

`.claude/settings.local.json` is the project-local
per-machine settings file that
[Step 12 pass 1](#step-12--post-install-sync--worktree-propagation--sandbox-allowlist--sanity-check)
populates with the agent-guard `hooks.PreToolUse` wiring (one entry,
resolving the snapshot) and that
[Step 12 pass 3](#step-12--post-install-sync--worktree-propagation--sandbox-allowlist--sanity-check)
separately populates with the project-root sandbox-allowlist entry
(and that each worktree carries independently). Most adopters
already gitignore this file by Claude Code convention; the
install flow checks for the line and adds it if missing.

## Step 8 — Wire up the framework-skill symlinks

The skill walks `<snapshot-dir>/skills/` and, for every
framework skill the adopter should have callable, creates a
gitignored **canonical** symlink at `.agents/skills/magpie-<skill>`
→ relative path into `<snapshot-dir>/skills/<skill>/`, plus a
**relay** symlink in every other active target dir.

The set of skills to link is the **union** of:

1. **The opt-in families the user picked in Step 5** (any
   combination of `security`, `pr-management`, `issue`,
   `release-management`, `repo-health`, `pairing`, `mentoring`,
   `contributor-growth`). Each contributes every framework skill
   in the snapshot whose `family:` frontmatter key equals that
   family — **not** by name prefix (per
   [`SKILL.md` Golden rule 8](SKILL.md#golden-rules)).
2. **The always-on families** (no user input — per
   [`SKILL.md` Golden rule 8](SKILL.md#golden-rules)):
   every `family: setup` skill *except* `setup` itself,
   and every `family: utilities` skill.

The always-on set is added on every run, even when the user
picked no opt-in families, even when `skill-families:` was
passed with a narrow value, and even on the SUBSEQUENT-
adoption path where the committed lock only records the
opt-in pick. Compute family membership fresh by reading the
`family:` key from each `SKILL.md` in the snapshot on disk — do
not hard-code skill names, and do not glob by prefix.

Symlink wiring (targets from [`agents.md`](agents.md)) — the
**canonical-plus-relay** model, applied identically no matter
what layout the adopter's `.claude/` / `.github/` were in before:

Every symlink is named `magpie-<n>` (the `magpie-` prefix
namespaces framework skills). Wire the **same set of skills**
into **every active target dir**, canonical first:

- **Canonical target (`.agents/skills/`)** — one symlink per
  skill at `.agents/skills/magpie-<n>` → relative path into the
  snapshot (`../../.apache-magpie/skills/<n>/`). Gitignored. This
  is the single placement that makes the framework discoverable to
  Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot, OpenCode, and the rest of
  the shared-path cluster, and the one source every relay points
  at.

- **Relay targets (`.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, any
  present holdout)** — one symlink per skill at
  `<target>/skills/magpie-<n>` → `../../.agents/skills/magpie-<n>`
  (pointing back at the canonical entry, **not** the snapshot).
  Gitignored. The adopter's own native (non-`magpie-`) skills in
  these dirs are left untouched.

**Never overwrite an existing committed skill** of the same
name. Surface conflicts and stop. The bootstrap `setup` skill
is the one committed skill (as `magpie-setup`) — the symlink
wiring step skips it by name; the committed copy is reconciled
in
[Step 3b](#step-3b--reconcile-the-committed-setup-with-the-new-snapshot--reload-in-flight),
not here.

Show the symlinks the skill is about to create, grouped by
*opt-in family* / *always-on family*, ask the user to
confirm, then create them. Always-on entries are surfaced
read-only — the prompt is "confirm this list" not "edit this
list".

## Step 8b — Wire up trusted external-source skills

If `<project-config>/skill-sources.md` (the adopter trust list)
exists and lists any source, run the
[`skill-sources`](skill-sources.md) sub-action now as a content
pass: fetch + verify each trusted source into
`.apache-magpie-sources/<id>/`, write both source locks, and
create the canonical + relay `magpie-<name>` symlinks for the
skills each source `provides` — the same wiring Step 8 does for
framework skills, just targeting the source snapshots. Nothing is
fetched if the trust list is absent or empty (the common case);
this step is then a no-op.

Source skills are `magpie-`-prefixed and gitignored exactly like
framework skills, so the `.gitignore` block from
[Step 7](#step-7--gitignore-entries-fresh-only) already covers
their symlinks; the `.apache-magpie-sources/` snapshot dir and
`.apache-magpie.sources.local.lock` were added there too.

## Step 9 — Scaffold `.apache-magpie-overrides/` (FRESH only)

Create `<repo-root>/.apache-magpie-overrides/` (directory) and scaffold the configuration by copying the template files from `<snapshot-dir>/projects/_template/` into it (excluding `.gitignore` and `pr-management-triage-ci-check-map.md` by default, to keep the committed override surface minimal).

Create `.apache-magpie-overrides/README.md` with the following content:

```markdown
# apache-magpie overrides

Agent-readable instructions that override specific steps or
behaviours of apache-magpie framework skills, scoped to
this adopter repo. Each override file is named after the
framework skill it modifies (e.g. `pr-management-triage.md`
overrides the `pr-management-triage` skill).

The framework skills consult this directory at run-time
before executing default behaviour. See
[`docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md`](https://github.com/apache/magpie/blob/main/docs/setup/agentic-overrides.md)
in the framework for the full contract.

**Hard rule**: never modify the snapshot under
`<repo-root>/.apache-magpie/`. Local mods go here.
Framework changes go via PR to `apache/magpie`.

**Personal (non-shared) overrides** belong in
`<repo-root>/.apache-magpie-local/` (gitignored). Use that
directory for per-developer paths, local tooling, or role-
specific capability enablements you do not want committed
to this repo.
```

**Pre-populate `project.md`**:
- Read the template `projects/_template/project.md` from the snapshot.
- Replace the placeholder `TODO` lines with the values auto-sourced in Step 4b:
  - Always (organization-agnostic): `upstream_repo`, `upstream_default_branch`, `product_family_url`, `labels`.
  - **Only when `organization: ASF`** (the ASF-specific block of Step 4b): `dev_list`, `commits_list`, `users_list`, `private_list`, `security_list`, `announce_list`. For a non-ASF `organization`, leave these as `TODO` — do not write `apache.org` addresses.
- Prompt the user to confirm the auto-sourced values, and only ask them to input values for stable fields that were absent or couldn't be derived.
- Stage the written files in `.apache-magpie-overrides/` to git (`git add`).

**CI check map (optional)**:
- Do **not** require or scaffold `pr-management-triage-ci-check-map.md` by default. Adopters who want finer-grained buckets can later create or copy it from the template manually. The triage workflow automatically defaults to a single generic pointer (`upstream_contributing_docs_url`) when this file is absent.

This directory is **committed** (overrides ship with the adopter repo).

Tell the user about the personal override surface:

> *"`.apache-magpie-local/` is gitignored (already in
> `.gitignore`). Create it at any time for per-person
> overrides that should not be committed — capability
> enablements, local clone paths, wording you want only
> for yourself. The framework reads it before the
> committed `.apache-magpie-overrides/` on every skill
> invocation."*

## Step 9b — Scaffold `user.md` (FRESH only)

Create the operator's per-user configuration file. The security
skills read it at run-time to resolve per-user preferences (PMC
status, local clone paths, optional tool backends). If the file
is missing, the skills fall back to interactive prompting and
offer to save the answer back into this file.

**Recommended location: `~/.config/apache-magpie/user.md`** — the
OS-conventional per-user config dir. One file, shared across every
worktree of every adopter project on the operator's machine, so
identity-and-tool-picks stay coherent without symlinks or
per-worktree bootstrap.

**Fallback location: `<repo-root>/.apache-magpie-overrides/user.md`** —
the legacy per-project location. Adopters with an existing
project-local `user.md` keep working without action; new adopters
should prefer the per-user location above.

The full resolution order (env override → per-user → per-project)
is documented in [`AGENTS.md` → *Per-project and per-user
configuration* → *`user.md` resolution order*](../../AGENTS.md#usermd-resolution-order).

Use this project-agnostic template:

```markdown
# Per-user configuration for apache-magpie

This file is committed in the adopter repo and holds preferences
that vary per developer (GitHub handle, local clone paths, optional
tool backends). It is **not** project-specific — those facts live in
`<project-config>/project.md`. Fill in the fields that apply to your
setup; the skills skip any block that is missing or marked `TODO`.

## `role_flags`

- `governance_member: TODO` — set to `true` if you are a member of the
  adopting project's governing body (a PMC member at the ASF; whatever
  the project's `governance.cve_allocation_gate` names elsewhere). Used
  by `security-cve-allocate` to decide whether you can submit the CVE
  allocation form directly or need to relay the request to a member.

## `environment`

- `upstream_clone: TODO` — absolute path to your local clone of the
  public `<upstream>` repo. Used by `security-issue-fix` when it
  writes changes and opens PRs. The skill validates that the clone
  has a remote pointing at your fork before proceeding.
- `upstream_fork_remote: TODO` — name of the git remote that points
  at your personal fork (e.g. `fork`, `your-github-handle`). If
  omitted, the skill uses the first non-`origin` remote that looks
  like a fork. Explicitly setting this avoids ambiguity when you
  have multiple remotes.

## `tools`

### `ponymail`

- `enabled: false` — set to `true` if you have registered the
  PonyMail MCP in your Claude Code `mcpServers` block. When enabled
  and authenticated, the security skills use PonyMail as the primary
  read backend for mailing-list archive queries; Gmail remains the
  fallback for just-arrived inbound mail and the only backend for
  draft composition. **ASF projects:** PonyMail is a mandatory
  prerequisite (the manifest declares it `mandatory: yes`), so set
  this to `true` and complete the install in Step 9c — the
  mail-reading skills refuse to run when it is unavailable or
  unauthenticated.
- `private_lists: []` — list of private mailing-list addresses that
  PonyMail should query (e.g. `["security@<project>.apache.org"]`).
  Only used when `enabled: true`.

### `apache-projects`

- `enabled: false` — set to `true` if you have registered the
  Apache Projects MCP in your Claude Code `mcpServers` block. When
  enabled, `contributor-nomination` and the roster-resolution paths
  in the security skills read ASF rosters / people / releases
  through it (read-only, no auth). **ASF projects:** this is a
  mandatory prerequisite (the manifest declares
  `project_metadata.mandatory: true`), so set this to `true` and
  complete the install in Step 9c.
```

**Where to write the file.** Default to
`~/.config/apache-magpie/user.md` for new adopters (the per-user
canonical location — shared across every worktree and every
adopter project on the operator's machine). If the operator
already has `<repo-root>/.apache-magpie-overrides/user.md` from a
previous setup, leave it alone — skills resolve the per-project
file as a fallback, no migration needed. If both exist, the
per-user file wins; surface the conflict to the operator so they
can pick one and delete the other.

Create the parent directory with `mkdir -p ~/.config/apache-magpie/`
before writing, then write the file at mode `0600` (the directory at
`0700`) since it holds personal preferences and — eventually —
identity that the operator may not want world-readable.

Show the file to the user and offer to fill in the `TODO` fields.
Do **not** ask one blind question per field — auto-detect what you
can, batch the rest, and skip questions that don't apply.

### Auto-detect first

- **`environment.upstream_clone`** — default to
  `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. Step 0 has already verified the
  current working directory is the adopter repo (not the framework
  itself), so this clone *is* the upstream clone. Surface the
  detected path; the user only intervenes if they keep multiple
  clones and want a different one as default.
- **`environment.upstream_fork_remote`** — read `git remote -v`.
  Apply this heuristic:
  - If `upstream` exists and points to the project's canonical
    repo, the *fork* is whatever non-`upstream` remote points at a
    URL containing the user's GitHub handle. With the standard
    `origin` = fork / `upstream` = canonical convention this is
    `origin`, and no question is needed — surface the detected
    value for confirmation.
  - If multiple remotes look like forks, ask the user which to
    pin, listing each candidate with its URL.
  - If only `origin` exists and it points at the canonical repo
    (legacy single-remote layout), leave the field as `TODO` and
    note in the surfaced summary that the user has not configured
    a fork remote yet.

### Batch the rest in a structured Q&A

When the agent harness offers a structured-question tool, ask the
remaining unknowns in **one batch** rather than serially. The
canonical batch is:

1. **`role_flags.governance_member`** — *single-select, default `No`*.
   "Are you a member of `<adopter>`'s governing body (e.g. a PMC
   member at the ASF)?" Used by `security-cve-allocate` to decide
   whether the user can submit the CVE allocation form directly or
   needs to relay through a member.
2. **Auto-detected env paths confirmation** — *single-select,
   default "Use as detected"*. Only ask this if both
   `upstream_clone` and `upstream_fork_remote` were auto-detected
   above; if either fell back to TODO, skip the confirmation and
   leave the relevant TODO in place. "Auto-detected
   `upstream_clone=<path>`, `upstream_fork_remote=<remote>` — use
   as detected, or customise?"
3. **`tools.ponymail.enabled`** — do **not** re-ask; set it from
   the **Step 5 MCP selection** (`ponymail` ticked → `true`). This
   value only *records* the Step 5 pick in `user.md`; the install
   is walked in Step 9c. (If Step 5 was skipped — e.g. no
   structured tool and the operator deferred MCP — fall back to
   the manifest default here: `mandatory: yes` → `true` and note
   it is **required**, `mandatory: no` → `false`.)

If `ponymail` was selected, collect **one more** value not asked
in Step 5 — do not ask it upfront:

4. **`tools.ponymail.private_lists`** — *free-text*. "List the
   private mailing-list addresses PonyMail should query (one per
   line, e.g. `security@<adopter>.apache.org`)."

5. **`tools.apache-projects.enabled`** — do **not** re-ask; set it
   from the **Step 5 MCP selection** (`apache-projects` ticked →
   `true`). Step 9c walks the install — the same `comdev` checkout
   serves both MCP servers. (Same Step-5-skipped fallback as (3):
   `project_metadata.mandatory: true` → `true`, else `false`.)

Free-form chat is the fallback when the harness has no
structured-Q&A tool. In that case still respect the order above
(auto-detection summary → unknowns → conditional follow-up); do
not interrogate one TODO at a time.

### Write and stage

After the answers come back, write the file to disk with the
collected values substituted in (leaving any unanswered field as
`TODO` so the per-skill prompts can still pick it up later) and
`git add` it.

## Step 9c — comdev MCP prerequisites (ASF projects)

**Run this step only for ASF projects.** Detect ASF by reading
`<project-config>/project.md`: the project is ASF when
`project_metadata.kind: apache-projects-mcp` with
`mandatory: true` **or** `Mail sources` declares `ponymail` with
`mandatory: yes` (both are the `_template` ASF defaults). A
present `.asf.yaml` at the repo root corroborates. When neither
mandatory flag is set (a non-ASF adopter that overrode them), skip
this step — the two MCP servers are optional and the operator
wires them up only if they answered `Yes` in Step 9b.

For ASF projects the
[PonyMail](../../tools/ponymail/tool.md) and
[Apache Projects](../../tools/apache-projects/tool.md) MCP
servers are **mandatory pre-flight prerequisites**, and — unlike
the pinned system tools — they are installed from the **latest
`main`** of `apache/comdev` (the servers ship as in-repo source
with no tagged releases; see
[`tools/ponymail/tool.md` → Keeping the checkout current](../../tools/ponymail/tool.md#keeping-the-checkout-current)).
A single `comdev` checkout serves both.

This step **guides and verifies — it never auto-runs `git clone`,
`npm install`, or edits the user's `mcpServers` block** (same
hands-off contract as the secure-setup install). Walk the operator
through it:

1. **Check what is already registered.** Inspect the session's
   tool list for `mcp__ponymail__*` and `mcp__apache-projects__*`.
   Both present → confirm the checkout health (jump to 3). Either
   missing → continue.
2. **Surface the install commands** (do not run them):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apache/comdev.git
   cd comdev && git checkout main          # track main, not a tag
   ( cd mcp/ponymail-mcp        && npm install )
   ( cd mcp/apache-projects-mcp && npm install )
   ```

   then the two `mcpServers` registrations (user scope shown):

   ```bash
   claude mcp add ponymail        node /abs/path/to/comdev/mcp/ponymail-mcp/index.js        -s user
   claude mcp add apache-projects node /abs/path/to/comdev/mcp/apache-projects-mcp/index.js -s user
   ```

   PonyMail additionally needs the one-time ASF LDAP login
   (`mcp__ponymail__login()`) — for ASF projects an **authenticated**
   session is required, not just a registered server. Apache
   Projects needs no auth.
3. **Confirm the checkout tracks `main` and is current.** Once
   registered, the freshness of the checkout is owned by the
   secure-setup flow:
   [`setup-isolated-setup-verify`](../setup-isolated-setup-verify/SKILL.md)
   asserts it is on `main` and not behind `origin/main`, and
   [`setup-isolated-setup-update`](../setup-isolated-setup-update/SKILL.md)
   runs the live `git fetch` + prints the `git pull --ff-only`.
   `setup verify` (check 8e) and `setup upgrade`
   (Step 6e) re-surface the same prereq so an ASF adopter does not
   have to remember to run the isolated-setup skills separately.
4. **Reflect the outcome** in the Step 9b `user.md` `tools` blocks
   (`ponymail.enabled` / `apache-projects.enabled`) and the
   recommended permission allow-list (the `mcp__apache-projects__*`
   read tools — see [`verify.md`](verify.md) check 8d).

Add `mcp__apache-projects__*` to the per-family permission
allow-list recommendation exactly as the `mcp__ponymail__*` tools
are handled — both are read-only and scoped.

## Step 9d — gmail-plaintext MCP (optional, Gmail drafters)

**Run this step when `gmail-plaintext` was ticked in the Step 5
MCP selection** — i.e. for operators who draft mail from an agent
(the `security` family's mailing-list replies, release announcements,
etc.). It is **optional** and not ASF-gated — unlike the comdev
servers in 9c, this one ships **in-repo** as part of the
[`oauth-draft`](../../tools/gmail/oauth-draft/README.md#mcp-server)
tool, so there is nothing to clone.

`gmail-plaintext` exposes one tool, `create_draft`, that POSTs a raw
`text/plain` message straight to Gmail's `drafts.create` — links go
out verbatim. Prefer it over the claude.ai Gmail connector's
`create_draft`, which rewrites embedded URLs into Google tracking
redirects (see
[`tools/gmail/draft-backends.md`](../../tools/gmail/draft-backends.md#privacy-warning--the-claudeai-gmail-mcp-rewrites-embedded-urls-into-google-tracking-redirects)).

Same hands-off contract as 9c — **surface, do not run**:

1. **Prerequisite — auth:** a Gmail OAuth credential at
   `~/.config/apache-magpie/gmail-oauth.json`. The operator can create it
   either with the
   [`oauth-draft-setup`](../../tools/gmail/oauth-draft/README.md#setup--one-time)
   CLI **or** by calling the server's own `setup_credentials` tool once —
   both run the same consent flow and write the same file, which also backs
   the CLI `oauth-draft-*` scripts.
2. **Surface the registration** (user scope; the `--extra mcp` pulls
   the optional `mcp` SDK):

   ```bash
   claude mcp add gmail-plaintext -s user -- \
     uv run --project <framework>/tools/gmail/oauth-draft --extra mcp oauth-draft-mcp
   ```

   The tools then appear under the `mcp__gmail-plaintext__*` prefix
   (`create_draft`, `setup_credentials`, `check_auth`). Registering at
   **user scope** installs it for the operator, not a single project — it
   is then usable by **any** agent session on the machine, Magpie-related
   or not (see [`tools/gmail/oauth-draft/README.md` → MCP server](../../tools/gmail/oauth-draft/README.md#mcp-server)).
3. **Reflect the outcome** in the recommended permission allow-list
   (add `mcp__gmail-plaintext__create_draft` alongside the Gmail read
   tools — see [`verify.md`](verify.md) check 8d). It only ever creates
   **unsent** drafts the human reviews and sends, so allow-listing it
   avoids a prompt on every draft.

## Step 10 — Worktree-aware post-checkout hook (FRESH only)

Install `<repo-root>/.git/hooks/post-checkout` — a best-effort
per-worktree reconciler that fires on `git checkout` and on
`git worktree add`. It carries **two** responsibilities, each
guarded independently so neither can gate the git operation:

1. **Sandbox allowlist.** Chain into the sandbox-allowlist helper
   installed by `setup-isolated-setup-install`, so the new
   worktree's working directory is added to the worktree's own
   `.claude/settings.local.json`'s `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead` /
   `allowWrite` (defensive against
   [issue #197](https://github.com/apache/magpie/issues/197)
   — see
   [`setup-isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md` → Step P](../setup-isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md#step-p--project-root-coverage-in-the-sandbox-allowlists)).

The hook does **not** deal with the agent-guard. That guard runs
from the install — the `magpie-agent-guard` plugin, or a
`settings.local.json` entry resolving the shared snapshot — so a
worktree needs nothing seeded for it
([`worktree-init` Step 1d](worktree-init.md#step-1d--agent-guard-needs-nothing-here)).

The hook is a small shell script. Surface the exact content to
the user before writing:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# apache-magpie post-checkout hook (installed by setup install).
# Best-effort per-worktree reconciliation on checkout / `git worktree add`.
# Every action is individually guarded and the hook always exits 0 — it
# never gates the surrounding git operation.
set -u

# (a) Sandbox allowlist (issue #197): add the current worktree's working
#     dir to the worktree's own .claude/settings.local.json. No-op when the
#     helper from setup-isolated-setup-install is absent.
if [ -x "$HOME/.claude/scripts/sandbox-add-project-root.sh" ]; then
  "$HOME/.claude/scripts/sandbox-add-project-root.sh" || true
fi

exit 0
```

The `|| true` guards (and the trailing `exit 0`) keep the hook
from failing the surrounding git operation (`git checkout`,
`git worktree add`) — the hook is best-effort reconciliation, not
a gate.

If the operator has not yet run `setup-isolated-setup-install`,
the helper-script line (a) is a no-op (the `-x` test fails). When
they later install the secure setup, no hook re-write is needed:
the next `post-checkout` fires the helper automatically.

Earlier versions of this hook also copied the agent-guard into each
new worktree. They no longer need to, and an adopter still carrying
that block should let [`upgrade`](upgrade.md#step-6b--sync-locally-installed-hooks-and-configuration)
re-install the current template: a hook that seeds a per-worktree
copy keeps alive the wiring that breaks **every** `Bash` call in any
worktree the copy did not reach.

**Why the allowlist line is shell-safe but symlink
reconciliation is not.** Line (a) shells out to a helper script — a
pure shell operation with no dependency on the agent harness.
Recreating the gitignored framework-skill symlinks is **not**: earlier
template versions of this hook also called
`setup verify --auto-fix-symlinks` to recreate
gitignored symlinks after a checkout. That line printed a spurious
`No such file or directory` error on every `git checkout` because
`setup` is a **Claude Code slash command**, not a shell
command, and the hook fires in the operator's shell where there is
no slash-command dispatcher. The line has been removed.
Symlink-drift reconciliation now happens **lazily** — the next
time the operator opens Claude Code in the worktree, the framework
skills' pre-flight drift check surfaces any missing symlinks and
`setup verify` (or any skill that needs the symlink)
prompts for the fix. Adopters whose existing hooks still contain
the broken line should remove it; the
[`setup-isolated-setup-update`](../setup-isolated-setup-update/SKILL.md)
drift check surfaces stale hook content on a routine sweep.

## Step 11 — Project doc updates (FRESH only)

Update two adopter-facing docs so contributors discover the
framework before they hit a "skill not found" error:

1. **`README.md` (contributor-facing summary, REQUIRED if
   the file exists).** This is the doc most fresh-clone
   contributors read first. Add a dedicated section. If the
   project uses PyPI-sync markers (e.g.
   `<!-- START Contributing ... -->` / `<!-- END Contributing ... -->`),
   place the new section **outside** any sync block so the
   adoption note does not leak into the published PyPI
   description.

   Suggested template — substitute the adopter's name and
   the skill families they actually installed:

   ```markdown
   ## Agent-assisted contribution (apache-magpie)

   This repo adopts the
   [`apache/magpie`](https://github.com/apache/magpie)
   framework via a snapshot mechanism. The framework provides
   maintainer-facing skills (e.g. `pr-management-triage`,
   `pr-management-code-review`, `pr-management-stats`,
   `pr-management-mentor`, and the `security-*` family)
   exposed as agent skills in agent harnesses such as Claude
   Code.

   The framework is **not** vendored — it lives as a
   gitignored snapshot under `.apache-magpie/`, fetched on
   demand from the version pinned in the committed
   [`.apache-magpie.lock`](.apache-magpie.lock). The only
   framework artefact committed to this repo is the
   `setup` skill at
   [`.agents/skills/magpie-setup/`](.agents/skills/magpie-setup/);
   everything else is a gitignored symlink the setup skill
   wires up.

   A fresh clone needs the snapshot populated before any
   framework skill is invocable. In your agent harness, run:

       setup

   (or follow [`.agents/skills/magpie-setup/`](.agents/skills/magpie-setup/))
   to fetch the snapshot per the committed lock, scaffold the
   gitignored symlinks, and install the post-checkout hook
   that re-creates them on each worktree checkout.

   Adopter-specific modifications to framework workflows live
   in [`.apache-magpie-overrides/`](.apache-magpie-overrides/)
   (committed) — never edit the snapshot directly. Framework
   changes go via PR to
   [`apache/magpie`](https://github.com/apache/magpie).
   ```

   Trim the skill-family list to what was actually picked in
   Step 5 (only mention `security-*` if the adopter installed
   that family, etc.). Skip this sub-step entirely if
   `README.md` does not exist.

2. **`AGENTS.md` (agent-facing detail, ONLY if the file
   already exists).** Agent harnesses load this file
   automatically; a short section here tells the agent the
   adoption is in place and where to find the contributor
   summary. Cross-reference back to the `README.md` section
   you just wrote so the agent lands on the human-readable
   summary first.

   Suggested template:

   ```markdown
   ## apache-magpie framework

   This repo adopts the
   [`apache/magpie`](https://github.com/apache/magpie)
   framework via the snapshot mechanism. The framework
   provides the `pr-management-*` skills; they are gitignored
   symlinks into the `.apache-magpie/` snapshot directory.

   A fresh clone needs the snapshot populated before any
   framework skill is invocable. Run `setup` (or
   follow [`.agents/skills/magpie-setup/`](.agents/skills/magpie-setup/))
   to fetch it per the committed
   [`.apache-magpie.lock`](.apache-magpie.lock). The
   contributor-facing summary of the adoption + setup flow
   lives in the
   [Agent-assisted contribution section of `README.md`](README.md#agent-assisted-contribution-apache-magpie).

   Adopter-specific modifications to framework-skill
   workflows live in
   [`.apache-magpie-overrides/`](.apache-magpie-overrides/)
   — never edit the snapshot directly. Framework changes go
   via PR to
   [`apache/magpie`](https://github.com/apache/magpie).
   ```

   **If the adopter installed the `pr-management-*` family**
   (Step 5), append the following subsection to the
   `AGENTS.md` block above, so the adopter's agent defaults to
   the framework's review skill. Skip it entirely for adopters
   who did not take that family.

   ```markdown
   ### Reviewing pull requests

   With apache-magpie installed locally, use the
   `magpie-pr-management-code-review` skill for PR code
   review. It posts findings as **inline review comments**
   anchored to `file:line`, presented **individually for
   accept/skip** before anything is submitted — prefer it
   over an ad-hoc review pass or a generic review command. A
   body-only review is the explicit opt-out (`inline:off`).
   ```

   Do not create `AGENTS.md` if it does not already exist —
   the contributor-facing section in `README.md` is the
   authoritative entry-point, and an empty `AGENTS.md` would
   be more noise than signal.

3. **`CONTRIBUTING.md` (fallback only).** If `README.md` is
   absent or strictly off-limits (some projects vendor it
   from another source and rebuild on release), add the
   `README.md` template content here instead.

**Doctoc and other auto-update hooks.** If the adopter
runs `doctoc` or similar README-TOC hooks, expect the next
commit to also touch the TOC block. Either run the hook
yourself before staging or note it in the commit message.

Surface the rendered diff (`git diff README.md AGENTS.md`)
to the user before writing. The user confirms once for the
whole doc set; do not ask separately per file.

## Step 12 — Post-install sync + worktree propagation + sandbox-allowlist + sanity check

Four passes, in this order:

1. **Sync hooks and config from the snapshot.** Walk every
   hook or config file the framework ships that an adopter
   is expected to carry locally — at minimum the
   `post-checkout` hook installed in
   [Step 10](#step-10--worktree-aware-post-checkout-hook-fresh-only),
   plus any other adopter-side hook or config file the
   framework adds in future. For each one, compare the
   adopter's installed copy against the snapshot's expected
   content; if drifted, re-install from the snapshot (after
   surfacing the diff and asking for confirmation when the
   local copy looks hand-edited). This is the "sync local
   versions with the framework's latest" pass and runs
   *every* time `setup` runs in either FRESH or
   SUBSEQUENT adoption — it is the same pass `setup
   upgrade` runs after a snapshot refresh.

   **The agent-guard PreToolUse hook is one such adopter-side
   file.** The framework ships
   [`tools/agent-guard`](../../tools/agent-guard/README.md) — a
   deterministic Claude Code `PreToolUse` guard that blocks
   `gh`/`git` commands which would ping maintainers, carry a
   `Co-Authored-By` trailer, mark a PR ready prematurely, leak
   security language publicly, or empty a PR via force-push. Sync
   **Nothing is copied for it.** The engine stays in the snapshot and
   the wiring points at it there, so this pass writes exactly one
   thing — and only for adopters not using the
   `magpie-agent-guard` plugin, which carries its own hook and needs
   no adopter-side wiring at all:
   - **Wire the hook once** in the **gitignored, per-machine**
     `.claude/settings.local.json` under `hooks.PreToolUse` (matcher
     `Bash`). Read the file if it exists (`{}` if absent), then merge
     in the entry. **Idempotent**: preserve every other top-level key
     and every other `hooks.PreToolUse` matcher untouched, and skip
     the write if a `Bash` entry already invokes `agent_guard`:

     ```json
     { "matcher": "Bash", "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
       "command": "python3 \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.apache-magpie/tools/agent-guard/src/agent_guard/__init__.py\"",
       "timeout": 30 } ] }
     ```

     The path resolves in **every** worktree, because
     [`worktree-init` Step 1](worktree-init.md#step-1--create-the-snapshot-symlink)
     symlinks each worktree's `.apache-magpie/` at the main
     checkout's snapshot. That is what removes the per-worktree
     seeding this step used to require. A plain `python3 "..."` call
     runs identically on POSIX and Windows.

     Rewrite an existing entry that still names the retired
     per-repository copy
     (`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py`): in any
     worktree without that copy, Claude Code reports the missing hook
     script as a tool error and **every `Bash` call fails**. Report
     leftover `.claude/hooks/agent-guard.py` + `guards.d/` as
     removable.

     Wiring happens **only once** per machine, and guards need no
     further syncing: the engine discovers the snapshot's bundled
     `guards.d/*.py` and every skill-owned `skills/*/guards/*.py` in
     place, so a new skill — or a skill that newly adds a guard —
     reaches an already-adopted repo through the snapshot refresh
     alone (see the tool README).

   **Codex project policy is the reviewed Codex half of the runtime
   support.** Merge the snapshot's `.codex/config.toml` and
   `.codex/rules/magpie.rules` into the adopter root:

   - On a fresh adopter with no matching file, copy and stage it.
   - Preserve unrelated TOML keys. If a required sandbox or approval
     value conflicts, surface the diff and ask the operator; never
     silently weaken the Magpie invariant.
   - Treat `magpie.rules` as Magpie-owned. Show hand edits before
     replacing them during a later sync.
   - Do not edit Codex project trust. Tell the operator to make the
     trust decision in Codex.

   Validate the merged result with `sandbox-lint --codex
   <repo-root>/.codex`. Both files are committed adopter
   configuration — nothing under `.codex/` is generated or
   gitignored. See
   [the Codex adapter](../../docs/adapters/codex.md).

2. **Propagate to every worktree (run `worktree-init`
   unconditionally).** The main is now adopted; any
   pre-existing linked worktree of this repo still lacks
   the snapshot symlink and the per-target framework-skill
   symlinks. `worktree-init` is **always run on every
   worktree** at the end of adopt, even when none exist
   yet, even when the worktree appears wired, because
   `worktree-init` is idempotent and the cost of an
   unnecessary run is trivially small. Conversely, *not*
   running it leaves worktree state inconsistent with the
   freshly-adopted main.

   Procedure:

   - Enumerate worktrees with
     `git worktree list --porcelain`. Filter to linked
     worktrees only — skip the main (already handled in
     Steps 1–11 above) and skip any bare worktrees.
   - If the list is empty, this pass is a no-op; record
     "no linked worktrees" in the recap and continue.
   - For each linked worktree, invoke
     `setup worktree-init` with that worktree's
     working directory as the `cwd`. The sub-action picks up
     the family set from `<main>/.apache-magpie.lock` plus
     the always-on families per
     [`SKILL.md` Golden rule 8](SKILL.md#golden-rules), and
     reconciles both the snapshot symlink and the canonical +
     relay framework-skill symlinks (see
     [`worktree-init.md` Step 1 + Step 1b](worktree-init.md)).
   - Collect each invocation's recap into a per-worktree
     row in the adopt summary's `Worktrees:` section.

   Do **not** abort adopt because one worktree failed — the
   main is already adopted, and the failing worktree is
   recorded in the summary for later resolution (typically:
   the user `cd`s there and re-runs `setup
   worktree-init` after merging the adoption commit
   forward).

3. **Add the adopter's project root to each worktree's
   project-local sandbox allowlists.** Defensive against
   [issue #197](https://github.com/apache/magpie/issues/197) —
   `sandbox.filesystem.allowRead: ["."]` does not in practice
   cover CWD, so reads under a freshly-cloned adopter repo
   fail under the sandbox until an explicit absolute path is
   added. Invoke the helper **with sandbox bypass** (the
   target file is in Claude Code's built-in sandbox
   `denyWithinAllow` set, so the Bash write is blocked without
   it — see
   [`docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md` → *Security rationale*](../../docs/setup/secure-agent-setup.md#security-rationale--why-project-local-is-safe-to-write-to)):

   ```bash
   ~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-add-project-root.sh --all-worktrees
   ```

   Set `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` on the Bash call with
   the reason *"writing project-local sandbox-allowlist entries
   (issue #197 fix)"*. Surface the bypass proposal to the
   operator **before** invoking — name the helper, name the
   target file (`.claude/settings.local.json` of each
   worktree), and confirm. The bypass triggers
   `sandbox-bypass-warn.sh`'s bold-red banner as a backstop, but
   the agent must propose first; do not silently approve.

   The helper enumerates `git worktree list --porcelain` and,
   for each worktree, writes that worktree's own absolute path
   into that worktree's own
   `<worktree>/.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored,
   per-machine, per-worktree). It does **not** write to
   user-scope or to the committed project-scope; see
   [`setup-isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md` → Step P](../setup-isolated-setup-install/SKILL.md#step-p--project-root-coverage-in-the-sandbox-allowlists)
   for the scope rationale. Idempotent — already-present paths
   are skipped.

   Failure modes:

   - **Helper absent** (`~/.claude/scripts/sandbox-add-project-root.sh`
     does not exist) → surface as ⚠ in the adopt summary with a
     pointer at `setup-isolated-setup-install`. Do not block
     adopt — many adopters set up secure-agent isolation later,
     and the framework-skill symlinks are usable without it (the
     adopter just runs Bash outside the sandbox until they wire
     in the secure setup).
   - **Helper present, exits non-zero** → surface as ✗ with the
     helper's stderr output, but continue with pass 4 and report
     the gap in the summary.
   - **Helper succeeds, no paths added** (everything already
     covered) → surface as ✓ "sandbox allowlist already covers
     this project + N worktrees".

   This pass is the same as
   [`upgrade.md` Step 6c](upgrade.md#step-6c--propagate-to-every-worktree-run-worktree-init-unconditionally)'s
   trailing helper-invocation step — both rely on `worktree-init`
   having run first (pass 2 above) so the worktree list is the
   one to feed the helper.

4. **Run the verify checklist.** Invoke
   [`verify.md`](verify.md)'s checks. Every check should be
   ✓ before the skill reports success. The hook-content
   drift check passes trivially because pass (1) just
   refreshed the hook from the snapshot; the worktree
   symlink checks pass trivially because pass (2) just
   ran `worktree-init` everywhere; the sandbox-allowlist
   check passes trivially because pass (3) just ran the
   helper.

## Output to the user

*(Pinned-snapshot path. The marketplace path's recap is
[Step M5](#step-m5--recap-and-what-comes-next).)*

A summary of what was written:

```text
✓ Method:   <method>
✓ Source:   <url>@<ref>
✓ Snapshot: .apache-magpie/ (commit <SHA>)
✓ Locks:    .apache-magpie.lock (committed) + .apache-magpie.local.lock (gitignored)
✓ Symlinks: <list of created symlinks>
✓ Overrides scaffold: .apache-magpie-overrides/ (committed)
✓ post-checkout hook installed (adds the worktree to the sandbox allowlist)
✓ agent-guard PreToolUse hook wired to the snapshot (nothing copied; no per-worktree seeding)
✓ Codex project policy merged and validated (.codex/config.toml + rules/magpie.rules)
✓ <repo>/README.md updated with adoption note

Committed (you'll see in `git status`):
  .gitignore
  .apache-magpie.lock
  .apache-magpie-overrides/README.md
  .agents/skills/magpie-setup/         (this skill itself — canonical copy)
  .claude/skills/magpie-setup          (relay symlink → ../../.agents/skills/magpie-setup)
  .github/skills/magpie-setup          (relay symlink → ../../.agents/skills/magpie-setup)
  .codex/config.toml                   (Codex sandbox + HITL posture; unrelated keys preserved)
  .codex/rules/magpie.rules            (Codex exec-policy)
  README.md (or CONTRIBUTING.md)

Gitignored (do NOT commit):
  .apache-magpie/
  .apache-magpie.local.lock
  .claude/settings.local.json   # per-machine sandbox allowlist (issue #197) + agent-guard wiring
  __pycache__/ + *.pyc       # byte-compiled artefacts from skill scripts; added to .gitignore if missing
  .agents/skills/magpie-*   (except magpie-setup, committed above)  # canonical links into the snapshot: opt-in + always-on families
  .claude/skills/magpie-*   (except magpie-setup, committed above)  # relays → ../../.agents/skills/magpie-*
  .github/skills/magpie-*   (except magpie-setup, committed above)  # relays → ../../.agents/skills/magpie-*
  # plus the same two lines for any present holdout (.windsurf/skills/, .goose/skills/, …)
```

Then suggest the user `git add` the committed files and open
a PR.

## Failure modes

- **Existing `<repo-root>/.apache-magpie/` and
  `<committed-lock>` are out of sync** → drift; suggest
  `setup upgrade`.
- **Existing committed skill conflicts with a framework
  skill symlink** → stop, name the conflict, let the user
  resolve.
- **Network failure on the snapshot download** → stop,
  surface the curl/git error.
- **`<committed-lock>` references a method/URL the runtime
  cannot reach** (e.g. svn-zip URL 404) → surface, ask the
  user whether the project has retired that release; the
  user updates `<committed-lock>` deliberately and re-runs.
- **The user's agent has no `/plugin` or extension command** →
  not a failure; it is the case the snapshot path exists for.
  Name it as the reason and continue from
  [Step 0](#step-0--pre-flight).
- **A marketplace install is already live and the user asks for
  the snapshot too** → surface the double-install trap
  ([`SKILL.md` Golden rule 10](SKILL.md#golden-rules)) and
  confirm which one the machine should keep before writing
  anything.
