# Mail-source adapter — mbox / local archive (stub)

Reference adapter for a static `mbox` (or `Maildir`, or a directory
of `.eml` files) as a read-only backend for the
`security-issue-import` family of skills. **Stub status** — this
document describes the contract; the concrete CLI wiring lands when
an adopter actually wires a local archive in.

See [`../contract.md`](../contract.md) for the abstract
mail-source-backend operations + capability matrix + adopter
resolution rules this adapter conforms to.

## When this adapter makes sense

* **Forensics / late triage of a historical security thread.** The
  inbox is gone or the role mailbox is no longer credentialed, but
  the messages were archived to an mbox snapshot at the time. The
  skill can still classify, extract template fields, and reconcile
  against trackers — it just can't draft a reply.
* **Air-gapped triage environments.** The agent runs offline against
  a thumbdrive snapshot of `<security-list>` for the time window
  being audited.
* **Compliance / discovery exports.** A regulator request produces
  an mbox export of all `<security-list>` mail for a time range; the
  skill imports it the same way it would import live mail, into a
  scratch tracker repo, without touching any live mail credentials.

## Capability claim

| Operation | Supported? | Notes |
|---|:---:|---|
| `list_recent_threads(list, since)` | ✓ (offline) | Parse the mbox, group messages by `References:` / `In-Reply-To:` chain, filter by message `Date:` newer than `since`. The `list` parameter is *advisory* — the mbox is whatever the operator pointed the adapter at, no remote subscription is checked |
| `read_thread(thread_id)` | ✓ | Same parser; return all messages in the thread |
| `list_drafts(thread_id)` | ✗ | A static archive has no concept of pending drafts |
| `list_sent_since(thread_id, since)` | ✗ (or limited) | Only if the archive includes the team's outbound mail (some exports do; many don't). The adapter declares this op as `unsupported` by default; an adopter with an outbound-included archive may upgrade the claim per-deployment |
| `create_draft(thread_id, body, …)` | ✗ | Read-only by construction |
| `thread_url(thread_id)` | depends | If the project has a public archive (PonyMail, Pipermail), construct the URL from the thread root's Message-ID. Otherwise return `file://<archive-path>#<message-id>` which only works in the operator's local environment |
| `thread_id_kind` | `rfc5322-message-id` | Same as IMAP — root Message-ID is the stable identifier |

## Auth + setup

There is no auth — the archive file is a file. The adopter
declares:

1. **Archive path** — absolute path to the mbox file, or to the
   `Maildir/` root, or to a directory of `.eml` files. The adapter
   sniffs format from the path shape.
2. **Time window cap** — optional safety knob to refuse parsing
   archives larger than `N` MB unless explicitly approved. Prevents
   accidental long-running parses of multi-year archives.
3. **Read-only enforcement** — the adapter MUST NOT write to the
   archive path under any circumstance. The framework's
   privacy-LLM gate (see [`../../privacy-llm/`](../../privacy-llm/))
   should also be considered before sending archive content to
   any LLM consumer.

## What an adopter declares in `project.md`

```markdown
## Mail sources

| Backend | Role | Mandatory | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mbox` | primary | yes | Forensics-only deployment; archive at `/srv/audit/security-list-2024.mbox` |
```

…or as a fallback for an otherwise-live deployment:

```markdown
| `gmail` | primary  | yes | Triager Gmail subscribed to `<security-list>` |
| `mbox`  | fallback | no  | 2024-Q4 snapshot at `/srv/snapshots/security-list-2024-Q4.mbox`; used when Gmail history is incomplete |
```

## Why this is a stub

No adopter is currently using it. The stub documents the contract
shape so a forensics / compliance team can wire the adapter
without re-designing the read interface; concrete parsing code
lands alongside this README when the first such adopter materialises.
