  README.md § How adoption works / Adopting the framework / Maintenance.
  Implemented by the setup family (setup and siblings) and the
  snapshot + agentic-override model.
acceptance:
  - The default install a fresh adopter is offered is the marketplace
    plugin; the snapshot install below is proposed only where a marketplace
    cannot reach (no plugin mechanism, signed artefact needed, committed pin
    wanted).
  - Installing and adopting are separate acts and are never conflated.
    An install touches only the invoking user's agent and writes nothing
    to the repo; it never proposes a repo-side artefact, on any harness,
    and a declined-or-absent repo side is a finished install. Adoption is
    the maintainer act of committing the repo's recommended default
    plugin set and its overrides store for every contributor, reached
    only through `setup adopt` and only on an explicit decision.
  - A repo's committed default set is a floor, never a ceiling: it does
    not limit what a contributor may install, and using Magpie on a repo
    that has not adopted it is a first-class path, not a degraded one.
  - On the pinned-snapshot fallback, an adopter commits exactly one
    skill (setup); everything else is a gitignored snapshot plus
    committed override + lock files. On the default marketplace
    install, nothing is committed to the repo at all.
  - The committed lock pins install method + URL + ref so a fresh clone
    re-installs the same framework version.
  - Drift between the committed pin and the local install is detected and
    surfaced with an upgrade proposal.
  - A gitignored `.apache-magpie-local/` supplies per-person overrides that
    layer above the committed `.apache-magpie-overrides/`, cannot weaken the
    safety baseline, and can be ignored for a single run via a one-shot
    default switch.
  - A marketplace install on Claude Code offers once, opt-in and defaulting
    to no, to write the committed default-set block and scaffold the
    `.apache-magpie-overrides/` config store together in a single question
    that states both are optional and that the plugins work in the repo
    either way; the offer is never asked on any other client.
  - Declining the offer, or running on a client where it is never asked,
    leaves a complete install; neither the recap nor verify describes the
    result as incomplete or partial.
  - The default-set floor stays fixed at the same three plugins regardless
    of which other families this maintainer installed; it never grows to
    include a maintainer-only family.
  - Writing the committed default-set block touches only
    `extraKnownMarketplaces` and `enabledPlugins` in
    `.claude/settings.json`, preserves every other top-level key and an
    existing `apache-magpie` marketplace definition, adds only the floor
    members missing from an existing `enabledPlugins` and removes nothing,
    creates the file with just those two keys when it is absent, refuses to
    rewrite a settings file that does not parse, and stages only the file
    it wrote — never commits it.
  - verify reports an absent committed default-set block through the
    non-fault glyph with an empty `missing` list, reports all three floor
    members present as current and equally non-faulting, reports
    some-but-not-all floor members present as stale, the one fault this
    check raises, naming the missing members in floor order with a repair
    offer, and gives an entry naming a plugin the marketplace no longer
    ships the same drift treatment.
  - uninstall removes only the three floor entries from `enabledPlugins`
    and the `apache-magpie` entry from `extraKnownMarketplaces`, keeps
    every other plugin and marketplace entry untouched, drops either key
    left empty by the removal, and never deletes `.claude/settings.json`.
  - docs/quick-start.md and docs/setup/marketplace.md both state that the
    committed default-set block is optional and not a prerequisite to using
    the plugins in the repo.

# Adoption & setup

## What it does

Gets the framework in front of an adopter and keeps it current. The
**default install is the marketplace plugin**
([`marketplace-distribution.md`](marketplace-distribution.md)) — per machine,
nothing in the repo. This surface is the **fallback and the repo-side half**:
a **snapshot + agentic-override** model — one committed bootstrap skill, a
gitignored framework snapshot (a build artefact, never committed),
gitignored skill symlinks, and committed agent-readable override files —
for agents with no plugin mechanism, adopters who need the signed ASF source
artefact, and projects that want every contributor and CI job pinned to one
committed version with drift detection.

## Where it lives

- Skill: `setup` (install, adopt/unadopt, verify, upgrade, override).
- Skills: `setup-isolated-setup-install` / `-update` / `-verify` / `-doctor`
  (the sandbox harness; `-doctor` probes live restrictions — SSH agent /
  Yubikey reachability, localhost port binding, filesystem restrictions),
  `setup-override-upstream` (promote a stabilised override into a
  framework PR), `setup-shared-config-sync`.
- Skill: `setup-status` — renders a Markdown adoption dashboard: install
  method and pin, drift between local and committed locks, which skills
  are wired in the current repo.
- Docs: `docs/setup/` (install recipes, agentic-overrides contract,
  prerequisites).
- Lock files: `.apache-magpie.lock` (committed pin) and
  `.apache-magpie.local.lock` (gitignored, what this machine fetched).

## Behaviour & contract

- **Marketplace first.** `setup install` with no `method:` proposes the
  marketplace install and prints the running agent's exact commands; it
  proposes the snapshot only for a stated reason (no plugin mechanism,
  signed artefact, committed pin, or the framework checkout itself). Both
  installs live on one machine at once is a supported *repo* state but a
  double-load for that machine — the skill surfaces it rather than stacking
  them silently.
- **One committed skill, no submodules, no vendored framework copies.**
  The snapshot lives in a gitignored `.apache-magpie/`.
- **`.agents/skills/` is the canonical home** for framework-skill
  symlinks (the path shared by Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Copilot, …);
  every other agent dir (`.claude/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, holdouts)
  gets per-skill relay symlinks into it. This is uniform — there is no
  per-project skills-dir convention to detect.
- **Committed lock is the source of truth.** A fresh contributor runs
  `/magpie-setup` and re-installs to the project's pinned version.
- **Drift detection** at the top of every framework skill: if the
  gitignored local lock has drifted from the committed pin, the skill
  proposes `/magpie-setup upgrade`.
- **Overrides are agent-readable Markdown** under
  `.apache-magpie-overrides/`, consulted at runtime and merged before
  default behaviour ([pairing/correctability is the model]).
- **Overrides are additive, never authority inversion.** An override may
  supply adopter-specific process details, paths, labels, or wording, but
  it must not replace or weaken the framework's safety, confidentiality,
  privacy, or external-content-as-data baseline. If an override conflicts
  with those baseline rules, the framework rule wins and the conflict is
  surfaced.
- **Personal, gitignored overrides** live under `.apache-magpie-local/`, a
  per-person sibling to the committed `.apache-magpie-overrides/` that is
  never committed. It is read at runtime under the same additive-only
  guardrail as any override: it may carry a person's paths, wording, or
  capability/MCP enablement (for example a release manager enabling a
  Policy MCP that other members leave off), but it cannot weaken the safety,
  confidentiality, or privacy baseline. Precedence, first hit wins:
  `.apache-magpie-local/` -> `.apache-magpie-overrides/` -> organization
  defaults -> framework default. Adoption scaffolds the overrides store; the
  `.gitignore` entry for the personal directory is the user's to add,
  wherever they prefer it, so the directory stays untracked. This is the surface that makes hybrid
  setups work: one person can run Magpie against a shared or non-adopting
  repo without committing anything or requiring teammates to opt in.
- **One-shot default run.** A per-invocation switch runs a skill against
  framework defaults for that session only, ignoring both
  `.apache-magpie-local/` and `.apache-magpie-overrides/`, without editing or
  removing either file. The safety baseline still applies.

## Out of scope

- The runtime behaviour of the modes themselves.
- Editing the adopter's `.claude/settings.json` beyond what the install
  recipe declares.

## Acceptance criteria

1. A fresh `setup install` proposes the marketplace path first, names the
   agent's commands, and reaches the snapshot flow only with a stated reason.
2. Adoption commits only the bootstrap skill + lock/override scaffold.
3. The committed lock re-installs the same version on a fresh clone.
4. Drift between local and committed locks is surfaced with an upgrade.
5. Override files can be discovered and surfaced to skills without
   editing upstream skill bodies, and override text cannot weaken the
   safety/confidentiality baseline.
6. A gitignored `.apache-magpie-local/` is read as a per-person override
   surface that layers above `.apache-magpie-overrides/` (personal-local ->
   committed -> organization -> framework default, first hit wins), under the
   same additive-only guardrail, and works on a repo that has not adopted
   Magpie once its `.gitignore` line is present.
7. A one-shot switch runs a skill against framework defaults for a single
   session, ignoring both override surfaces without deleting them, and the
   safety baseline still applies.

## Validation

```bash
test -f docs/setup/README.md
uv run --project tools/skill-and-tool-validator --group dev skill-and-tool-validate
```

## Known gaps

- **Marketplace distribution is a sibling surface**, specified separately in
  [`marketplace-distribution.md`](marketplace-distribution.md). It is the
  *default* way an adopter takes the framework; the snapshot install described
  here is the fallback. The skills delivered are the same tree either way —
  only the namespace of their invocation differs.

- `stable`; gaps appear as new agent targets to add to the registry
  ([`agents.md`](../../../skills/setup/agents.md)) or new override
  surfaces — recorded by the plan pass.
- **Not yet built:** the `.apache-magpie-local/` personal override surface
  (acceptance 5) and the one-shot default-run switch (acceptance 6). Both are
  intended behaviour recorded here and tracked as work items
  `magpie-local-convention` and `override-bypass-one-shot` in the plan. The
  three hybrid-setup how-tos that build on the local surface are tracked
  alongside them.
