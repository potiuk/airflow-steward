"""Merge-mode safety nets for ``vulnogram-api-record-update``.

The default Vulnogram API push is a full record replacement: whatever
JSON the script sends becomes the record. That model has bitten the
security team in three concrete ways during 2026:

* ``CVE-2026-41016`` — a regenerated push from the wrong sibling
  tracker moved the record's ``CNA_private.state`` from ``PUBLIC``
  back to ``REVIEW``, broke the ``cve.org`` advisory's lifecycle
  ownership, and required a manual revert.
* Same record — the regenerator overwrote ``affected[].product`` /
  ``packageName`` (the originally-published shape was
  ``Apache Airflow Providers SMTP`` / ``apache-airflow-providers-smtp``;
  the re-push from the core-scope sibling produced
  ``Apache Airflow`` / ``apache-airflow``), changing the meaning of
  the record after publication.
* Same record — the hand-added ``lists.apache.org/thread/<hash>``
  advisory URL in ``references[]`` was lost when the regenerated
  document only carried the fix PR.

This module supplies three guard checks the push can run before
sending. Each one is **opt-out**: by default the guard is active and
the push refuses (or merges) when it would otherwise regress the
record. Explicit override flags let a release manager force the
change when the regression is intentional.

The guards work on the **document body** that the API push sends
(``cveMetadata`` / ``CNA_private`` / ``containers``) versus the
**body** sub-object of the fetched record (Vulnogram's GET endpoint
wraps the same shape under ``body``). The asymmetry is unavoidable —
the API was built that way long before this module existed.

    ``current_doc`` is the record's current state as returned by

    ``files`` / ``body`` envelope). When ``None`` — the record does
    not exist yet — the guards are no-ops and ``new_doc`` is returned
    unchanged (no current state to compare against).

    ``new_doc`` is the body the script intends to push (``cveMetadata``
    / ``CNA_private`` / ``containers`` at the top level). A deep copy
    is taken before mutation; the input is not modified in place so
    the caller's reference stays stable.

    The three guards in order:

    1. **State downgrade**: refuse when ``current.CNA_private.state ==
       "PUBLIC"`` and ``new.CNA_private.state != "PUBLIC"``. Raise
       :class:`MergeModeRefused` unless ``allow_state_downgrade`` is
       ``True``. PUBLIC means the record was pushed to cve.org and
       walking it back to REVIEW / DRAFT is almost always an
       accidental side-effect of a regenerator re-push.
    2. **References merge**: when ``replace_references`` is ``False``
       (the default), union the current record's ``references[]``
       with the new emission's by URL, preserving any URL not in the
       new emission. This catches the hand-added advisory URL that
       the regenerator does not know about.
    3. **Product / packageName change**: when ``allow_product_change``
       is ``False`` (the default) and any ``affected[]`` entry's
       ``(packageName, product)`` signature differs between the
       current record and the new emission, raise
       :class:`MergeModeRefused` with a diff so the caller can decide
       whether the change is intentional (e.g. broadening the scope
       to add a new package) or a regression.
