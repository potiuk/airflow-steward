## Eval output format

You are executing Step 2 (existing-PR check) in isolation. The tracker
state, discussion thread, and GitHub search results are provided in the
user turn as mock data. Determine whether an existing PR addresses the
issue and return ONLY valid JSON with these fields:

```json
{
  "existing_pr_found": true | false,
  "pr_url": "<URL of the existing PR, or null>",
  "pr_addresses_issue": true | false,
  "recommended_action": "adopt" | "supersede" | "proceed",
  "reason": "<one-sentence explanation for the recommendation>"
}
```

- `existing_pr_found` is `true` when any of the three discovery methods
  (tracker body field, tracker comments, GitHub search) yields a PR that
  plausibly addresses the same root cause.
- `pr_url` is the URL of the most relevant existing PR, or null when none
  is found.
- `pr_addresses_issue` is `true` when the existing PR targets the same
  root cause as the tracker issue (even if incomplete or stale).
- `recommended_action` is:
  - `"adopt"` when an existing PR addresses the issue (regardless of
    whether it needs minor improvements);
  - `"supersede"` when an existing PR exists but is fundamentally wrong
    or abandoned beyond repair;
  - `"proceed"` when no existing PR is found — the skill should continue
    to Step 3 (fixability assessment).
- `reason` explains the recommendation in one sentence.
