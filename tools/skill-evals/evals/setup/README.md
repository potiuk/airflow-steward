# setup evals

Behavioral evals for the `setup` skill.

## Suites (26 cases total)

| Suite | Step | Cases | What it covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| step-verify-drift | verify.md § Check 3 (drift) | 5 | clean, method/URL mismatch, ref mismatch, svn-zip SHA-512 mismatch, local lock missing |
| verify-default-set | verify.md § Committed default set | 3 | no committed `enabledPlugins` block (absent, not a fault), all three floor members present (current), some but not all present (stale — the only fault this check reports) |
| uninstall-default-set | uninstall.md § Committed default set | 2 | committed block is exactly the floor (all three removed, nothing kept), a mixed block with other Magpie and other-vendor plugins (only the floor removed, everything else kept) |
| step-overrides-surface | overrides.md § Step 0b | 4 | adopted no flag (offer choice), --local flag (personal), not adopted (personal only), both surfaces exist |
| step-override-bypass | agentic-overrides.md § One-shot defaults run | 3 | `--no-overrides` flag + override exists, `--no-overrides` + no override, no flag + override exists |
| step-m5-no-repo-offer | install.md § Step M5 — Recap and what comes next | 4 | An install writes nothing repo-side on any harness and is complete as it stands: Claude Code fresh, Codex, Gemini (no offer in any of them), plus the one case where adoption legitimately comes up — the user asked for the team to get it on clone |
| step-adopt-settings-merge | adopt.md § Merge rules | 5 | no `.claude/settings.json` (create), file with unrelated keys (merge, preserve them), existing `enabledPlugins` with non-floor and non-Magpie entries (add only the missing floor members, remove nothing), existing pinned `apache-magpie` marketplace definition (left alone), malformed JSON (refuse, never rewrite) |

## Run

`--cli` is required or nothing is graded; use `--directory`, not
`--project`, and run from the repo root.

```bash
# All cases
uv run --directory tools/skill-evals skill-eval --cli "claude -p" \
    evals/setup/

# Single suite
uv run --directory tools/skill-evals skill-eval --cli "claude -p" \
    evals/setup/step-override-bypass/

# Single case
uv run --directory tools/skill-evals skill-eval --cli "claude -p" \
    evals/setup/step-override-bypass/fixtures/case-1-flag-override-exists
```

## Notes

- `step-verify-drift` cases are fully auto-comparable: all three output
  fields (`status`, `severity`, `remediation`) are enumerated strings.
- `verify-default-set` cases are fully auto-comparable: `status` and
  `is_fault` are an enumerated string and a boolean, and `missing` is a
  plain list. Case 1 (absent) is the one that matters most — it checks
  that the skill states the optionality strongly enough that `is_fault`
  comes back `false` for a block that was never committed.
- `uninstall-default-set` cases are fully auto-comparable: `plugins_removed`,
  `plugins_kept`, and `keys_preserved` are plain lists, and `file_deleted` is
  a boolean. Both cases report only the raw shape of
  `.claude/settings.json` (its top-level keys and the contents of
  `enabledPlugins`), never which entries the answer should sort into which
  list — the model has to apply the floor-removal rule itself. Case 2
  (mixed) is the one that matters most — it checks that non-floor Magpie
  plugins and other vendors' plugins both survive untouched alongside an
  unrelated top-level key.
- `step-overrides-surface` tests the new `--local` flag and personal-
  vs-shared surface selection introduced by the `magpie-local-convention`
  work item.  The default surface when the repo is adopted and no flag is
  passed is `"offer-choice"`; `override_path` reports the personal default.
- `step-override-bypass` cases are fully auto-comparable: `decision` and
  `safety_baseline` are enumerated strings, and `reason` is checked by
  deterministic `regex` predicates in `assertions.json`
  (`has_bypass_reason` for the skip cases, `has_apply_reason` for the
  apply case) — no grader or MANUAL step is required.
  The two predicates discriminate on *direction*, not on the flag name.
  Keying on `no-overrides` would be useless here: the flag name appears
  in a correct reason and in a reason arguing the exact opposite, so such
  a pattern passes either way. Each predicate therefore requires the
  matching verb (skipped/not-consulted versus applied/consulted) and
  rejects the opposing phrasing. When editing them, check both
  directions — that a right answer still passes *and* that a reason
  arguing the other decision fails.
