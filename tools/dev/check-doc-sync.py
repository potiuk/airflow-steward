"""Check the documentation claims that must track the tree, and silently rot.

Ten checks, all mechanical, each one written after the drift it catches was
found by hand:

1. **Spec-index completeness.** Every ``tools/spec-loop/specs/<name>.md`` is
   listed in both ``overview.md`` and ``README.md``. Ten specs were absent from
   both — including per-family specs and one added four PRs earlier — because
   nothing checked, and an index that lists two-thirds of its subject reads
   exactly like one that lists all of it.

2. **Per-family skill counts in README.md.** The family table's "N skills" cell
   against the live ``family:`` frontmatter. Two cells were wrong: one went
   stale when three skills landed, the other had been drifting for months.

3. **Per-mode skill counts in docs/modes.md.** The *Modes at a glance* table's
   Skill-count column against the live ``mode:`` frontmatter. The validator's
   ``modes-doc`` rule checks section *membership* but reads only the mode and
   status columns, so the counts were unguarded.

4. **Total-skill claims in prose.** A small allowlist of files whose "N skills"
   phrasing means the whole catalogue.

5. **Per-family *plugin* skill counts.** The marketplace tables in
   ``docs/setup/marketplace.md`` and ``docs/quick-start.md`` list a bare count
   per ``magpie-<family>`` plugin, plus a total for the all-in-one ``magpie``
   row. Check 2 does not reach them — those cells are bare integers in a table
   column, not the "N skills" phrasing check 4 matches — so both tables sat two
   families out of date (``security`` 12, ``utilities`` 4, total 70) while
   README.md, which *is* guarded, carried the right numbers. These counts drive
   an install decision, so a stale one costs the reader context they were
   choosing against.

6. **Per-family skill counts in the family READMEs.** Each
   ``docs/<family>/README.md`` opens with an "Install & first runs" section
   claiming "one plugin, N skills". Ten more numbers a human would have to
   remember; the family is read from the install command in the same file, so
   ``issue`` under ``docs/issue-management/`` resolves correctly.

7. **No family-plugin invocation stutters the family name.** A doc showing
   ``/magpie-security:security-issue-triage`` says "security" twice — the
   family plugin advertises a de-stuttered alias
   (``/magpie-security:issue-triage``), so the stuttering form is a command
   nobody can run.

8. **The portable single-token form declares its install.** A doc showing
   ``/magpie-<skill>`` is teaching a command that exists only on a snapshot or
   self-adoption install; since the marketplace install is now the default, the
   page has to say so. ``/magpie-setup`` is exempt — it names the install
   *mechanism* — and a filesystem path (``.agents/skills/magpie-<skill>/``,
   several of which are ``test -f`` assertions in the spec files) is not an
   invocation.

9. **Published always-on token figures track the live frontmatter.** Delegates
   to ``estimate-skill-tokens.py`` so the measurement lives in one place.

10. **Every script in ``tools/dev/`` is named in its README.** These scripts are
    the framework's own gates, and an undocumented one is invisible to the next
    contributor who has to decide whether it applies to their change. Naming it
    is the minimum; the README says what each guards.

Why counting is worth a hook at all: every one of these is a number a human has
to remember to update while thinking about something else, and none of them
breaks anything when wrong. They just quietly mislead the next reader.
